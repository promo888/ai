e7883e44-6bc7-3e81-ae1d-08d5c54b96e3;AAPL;Apple Sued Over Not Taking Down Telegram After Capitol Hill Riot;"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been sued in California over allegations it failed to take action against messaging app Telegram in the aftermath of the Capitol Hill riot even as the platform was used to promote violence.What Happened: The Coalition for a Safer Web,  a Washington D.C.-based non-profit organization, filed the lawsuit against Apple in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Sunday.The group alleges that ""Telegram is being used to intimidate, threaten, and coerce members of the public,"" and Apple -- despite reportedly having this knowledge -- lets Telegram be available through the App Store on its devices.The lawsuit further alleges that not only was Telegram used to promote violence during the storming of Capitol Hill by outgoing President Donald Trump's supporters earlier this month, also ""for years, anti-black and anti-Semitic groups have openly utilized Telegram with little or no content moderation by Telegram's management.""""Apple has not taken any action against Telegram comparable to the action it has taken against Parler to compel Telegram to improve its content moderation policies."" CSW claims.Why It Matters: Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, in a statement late Monday, thanked ""everyone who reported public channels that crossed the line"" in the recent weeks, without mentioning the lawsuit.""Telegram welcomes peaceful debate and protest, but our Terms of Service explicitly prohibit distributing public calls to violence,"" Durov said. ""In the last 7 years, we've consistently enforced this rule globally, from Belarus and Iran to Thailand and Hong Kong.""Apple, alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) withdrew social media app Parler from their platforms over similar allegations of promoting violence during the Capitol Hill riot. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) too withdrew hosting support, effectively forcing Parler to go offline, at least temporarily.Telegram, alongside rival privacy-focused messaging app Signal, has seen a surge in downloads owing to Facebook Inc.'s (NASDAQ: FB) WhatsApp's new proposed privacy policy.Price Action: Apple shares closed 1.37% lower at $127.14 on Friday.Read Next: Elon Musk Sends Signal Downloads Soaring: What You Should Know About The AppSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Parler Finds Its Way Back Online — Thanks To A Russian Tech Firm  * Why Jack Dorsey Sees Bitcoin As The Answer To Donald Trump Ban Controversy(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

3882f3fe-5974-3e81-964d-bc63ad95ee25;AAPL;Sequoia Said to Invest in Auto1 at $7.2 Billion Value Before IPO;(Bloomberg) -- Sequoia Capital agreed to invest in Auto1 Group SE at a valuation of about 6 billion euros ($7.2 billion) ahead of the German online car-trading platform’s initial public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said.The U.S. venture capital firm and rival fund Lone Pine Capital reached a preliminary deal to each buy about 50 million euros of Auto1stock from early investor DN Capital, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. They have agreed to a lock-up period of six months, the people said.Sequoia and Lone Pine also signaled plans to invest at least 50 million euros apiece in Auto1’s imminent IPO, the people said.The move marks a vote of confidence in Auto1, which is backed by Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group Corp., and the business of buying and selling cars online. Auto1 said last week it aims to raise about 1 billion euros from a Frankfurt share sale in the first quarter.A spokesperson for Auto1 declined to comment. An official at DN Capital didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, while representatives for Sequoia and Lone Pine couldn’t immediately be reached during a U.S. public holiday.DN Capital became one of Auto1’s first backers when it invested in the company in 2013, the year after the German startup was founded, according to its website. The venture capital firm previously invested in app developer Shazam Entertainment Ltd., which created a music-identification service later bought by Apple Inc. It also helped fund U.K. online realtor Purplebricks Group Plc and international money transfer service Remitly Inc.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Mon, 18 Jan 2021 17:02:09 +0000;AAPL_2021-01-18;0.9516;0.34

Answering Wallace's question about whether or not big tech is restricting speech, Cook said: ""We have an App Store that has about 2 million apps in it. And we have terms of service for these apps. We obviously don't control what's on the internet, but we've never viewed that our platform should be a simple replication of the internet. We have certain rules and regulations, and we just ask that people abide by those.""When asked whether there could be a balance between free speech and objectionable content, the chief executive said he doesn't believe there's a place for violence when it comes to free speech. ""We looked at the incitement to violence that was on there, and we don't consider that free speech and incitement of violence has an intersection,"" he said.Apple took down Parler on Jan. 9, a day after sending a warning note to the platform's executives demanding they provide a moderation plan within 24 hours.Cook said the company is not banned but rather suspended, and could be allowed back. ""If they get their moderation together, they would be back on there,"" Cook said during the interview.Cook and Wallace also discussed Apple's $100 million Racial Equity Initiative, which last week launched an Apple Developer Academy in Detroit.Why It Matters: Parler, viewed as a far-right social media platform, has come under fire since the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. It has been accused of failing to moderate discussions and plans of the attack.

01e41efd-f1df-31fb-a582-cdfa6f78161d;AAPL;"Apple Considers Foldable iPhone; Minor Changes Planned for 2021 Models";(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has begun early work on an iPhone with a foldable screen, a potential rival to similar devices from Samsung Electronics Co. and others, though it’s planning only minor changes for this year’s iPhone line.The Cupertino, California-based company has developed prototype foldable screens for internal testing, but hasn’t solidified plans to actually launch a foldable iPhone. The development work hasn’t expanded beyond a display, meaning Apple doesn’t yet have full handset prototypes in its labs, according to a person familiar with the work, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.Like Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, the Motorola Razr reboot and other offerings from Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co., a foldable iPhone would let Apple make a device with a larger screen in a more pocketable package. Apple has internally discussed a number of foldable screen sizes, including one that unfolds to a similar size as the 6.7-inch display on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Current foldable phones have screens that are from 6 and 8 inches unfolded.The foldable Apple screens in testing, like those from Samsung, have a mostly invisible hinge with the electronics stationed behind the display, the person said. Other companies, including Microsoft Corp., have recently launched devices with visible hinges separating two distinct panels. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.This would be a radical departure for Apple. Its pioneering touchable, all-screen smartphone is arguably the most successful consumer technology product in history, helping make Apple the world’s most valuable company. However, a foldable iPhone is likely years away or ultimately may never be introduced. The company is currently focused on launching its next-generation flagship iPhones and iPads later this year. Apple isn’t planning major changes for this year’s iPhone line given the enhancements made to the smartphone in 2020, including 5G and new designs, according to people familiar with the situation. Inside Apple, engineers consider the next iPhones another “S” version of the device, the nomenclature typically given to new iPhones with minor upgrades. The Covid-19 pandemic has also complicated product development, with Apple hardware engineers only working at the company’s Silicon Valley offices a few days a week and in limited numbers. That has meant offloading work to Apple’s engineers in China.Last year, the pandemic delayed the iPhone 12’s release by several weeks, but Apple was able to still include nearly every intended feature except an accessory dubbed “AirTags” for locating physical items like backpacks and keys. The company now plans to launch that accessory this year, and it is planning multiple accessories for it including a leather keychain. Samsung announced a similar gizmo earlier this month. Though overall changes will be minor, Apple is still testing a key upgrade for 2021: an in-screen fingerprint reader. This would add a new method for users to unlock their iPhone, going beyond a passcode and Face ID facial recognition. Apple started to move away from fingerprint sensors in 2017 with the launch of the iPhone X, but Touch ID has remained as a feature on Mac laptops and cheaper iPhones since then. Qualcomm Inc., which provides Apple with 5G modems, earlier this month announced a faster in-screen fingerprint sensor. Read more: Apple Plans Return of Touch ID and New Cheap iPhoneThe feature would be convenient in an environment where users wear masks, which are often incompatible with facial recognition. An in-screen fingerprint reader, which has also been featured on Android phones for several years, could also be quicker than Face ID for some users. Apple won’t remove its facial recognition scanner though as it’s still useful for augmented reality and camera features.Apple has also discussed removing the charging port for some iPhone models in favor of wireless charging. The company moved to a magnetic MagSafe charging system with the iPhone 12, in addition to removing the charging brick from the iPhone box last year. It’s also bringing this charging technology back to the MacBook Pro. For its tablet line, Apple is planning a new iPad Pro that looks similar to the current model but adds a MiniLED display and much faster processor. A thinner and lighter entry-level iPad that uses the same design as the 2019 iPad Air is also in the works.

2d9c21d8-1c48-3dd0-9586-353493262902;AAPL;Michelob Ultra Goes Greener With Aluminum in MacBooks;(Bloomberg) -- Michelob Ultra beer is getting an upgrade: it’ll be served in cans made from the same aluminum used in Apple MacBooks.The appeal of the metal is a better carbon footprint. Beermaker Anheuser-Busch InBev NV and metal producer Rio Tinto Group said Friday that the new cans are partly made using a “carbon-free” process that eliminates greenhouse gases. The specialty metal comes from a joint venture between Rio Tinto and Alcoa Corp., called Elysis, which has counted Apple Inc. among its backers.American consumers have been demanding and paying more for food and beverages that make sustainability claims, causing many traditional brands to scramble for an edge among shoppers.The move to lower-carbon cans advances “the transition toward more sustainable packaging” and also provides traceability, Tolga Egrilmezer, Rio Tinto’s vice president of sales and marketing, said in a statement. “Responsibly produced aluminium can play key role in helping our customers deliver the sustainable products expected by today’s consumers.”The new aluminum-making process emits oxygen instead of carbon, a process that could revolutionize the industry if it’s successful at a commercial scale.Rio Tinto said 2.5 million of the cans will be distributed over the coming months. Michelob Ultra is the second-highest selling beer by dollars in the U.S. after Bud Light, according to data from research firm IRI.More details: The Michelob Ultra cans were manufactured at Anheuser-Busch’s Metal Container Corporation facility in Jacksonville, Florida, using the Elysis aluminum cast into sheet ingots from Rio Tinto’s plant in Quebec, Canada.The companies did not provide specific volume or mix of aluminum coming from the Elysis joint-venture.Anheuser-Busch partnered with Rio Tinto in October to market the lower-carbon cans.(Updates with scale of can distribution in sixth paragraph. A previous version corrected the Apple products the aluminum is used in.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Fri, 15 Jan 2021 20:10:55 +0000;AAPL_2021-01-15;0.9531;0.0

56a3f4d1-e86e-3a3f-bf5e-1c6971554bc6;MSFT;Microsoft Stock Is a Safe Choice Among Big Tech Companies;When it comes to growth stocks, we often look to the tech sector. However, some investors are a little nervous about big technology and social media giants these days. Most of the FAANG stocks are under increasing scrutiny. The prospect of government actions over monopolistic behavior is looming. One way to invest in a big tech company while minimizing risk is to go with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). It didn’t post spectacular gains in 2020, but MSFT stock still managed 40% for the year. Few investors would complain about that kind of return. Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com More importantly, Microsoft has already had its monopoly scare and survived intact. The company is not in regulator sights, effectively removing that wildcard from the equation. Big Tech Risks Regulation Big technology companies have been in the headlines for the past several years but for reasons that make investors anxious. Yes, many have achieved incredible growth. But some have done so by snapping up competing companies before they become a threat.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Social media companies have become platforms for news and essential communication, which makes them rife for targeting by bad actors. App stores have become huge moneymakers, but tech companies that take a big cut of sales are beginning to generate a backlash. This all began to come to a head in 2020. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is taking action against what it sees as illegal monopolization. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is actively investigating antitrust allegations related to how app stores are run. In the European Union, the drumbeat is growing to break up big tech companies. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon It’s hard to say what may come of all this. It could be anything from tech companies being forced to divest themselves of divisions, to large fines, to increased regulation. The uncertainty has many investors spooked — which is completely understandable. Microsoft has been largely absent from these conversations. Why? The biggest reason is that Microsoft was the poster child for these very same actions two decades ago. In 2000, the company was found to be a monopoly and ordered to be split up. After a series of appeals, moves to satisfy regulators and the growth of competing tech companies that diluted Microsoft’s influence, the company survived intact. But MSFT stock took a beating and then stagnated for over a decade. Today, however, Microsoft is back. Over the past five years, MSFT stock has posted 318% growth. And unlike in the 1990s, Microsoft has largely avoided situations that would attract regulators. Long-Term Moneymakers and High Profile Products Microsoft growth continues to be powered by legacy products like Windows and Office. The company transitioned Office from packaged software to a subscription model with cloud-based versions and support for mobile platforms. As a result, the Office cash cow continues, decades after it was first released. But now it is largely recurring revenue. In its last quarter, Microsoft reported Office 365 commercial revenue up 21% year-over-year (YoY), while Office consumer products and cloud revenue was up 13%. In addition, Microsoft has a healthy cloud-computing business. During that last quarter, intelligent cloud revenue hit $13 billion, with Azure revenue growth up 48% YoY. Microsoft is also expecting to see a big boost from two key products through 2021. Teams had a breakout year in 2020 thanks to the pandemic forcing many companies to have staff work from home. MSFT is on the attack, rapidly increasing Teams functionality to take on competitors in the remote collaboration, video conferencing and voice call markets. At this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, computer monitors with a dedicated Teams button made an appearance. The Series X/S next generation game consoles will also figure prominently in Microsoft’s future. Gaming is increasingly important to the company’s bottom line. The November 2020 launch was described by Microsoft as “the most successful debut in our history,” with more of the new consoles sold than in any previous generation. 2021 will be the first full year of Xbox Series X/S sales. That is expected to pump money into Microsoft’s coffers as gamers line up to buy the latest and greatest new consoles, along with games and services like Xbox Live. Bottom Line on MSFT Stock The bottom line on MSFT stock is that it’s a great option if you want to invest in a high-growth technology giant with long-term staying power. Especially if you’re concerned about the current regulatory scrutiny so many of these companies find themselves under. On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in MSFT.

24596fff-aa08-32bf-bc95-35373daa8e53;MSFT;The 7 Top Dividend Stocks for 2021;"Last year was a tale of two halves for dividend equities. Owing to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the first half of 2020 was chock full of payout cuts and suspensions by S&amp;P 500 member firms, but dividends rebounded mightily in the second half of the year, indicating that many of the top stocks for 2021 are dividend payers. The fourth-quarter trajectory of S&amp;P 500 payouts indicates that the darkest clouds of the coronavirus cuts have passed. And dividend investors could be in for better things this year. “Indicated dividend net changes (increases less decreases) for U.S. domestic common stocks increased $9.5 billion during Q4 2020, compared to a decline of $2.3 billion in Q3 2020, and a gain of $10.6 billion in Q4 2019,” noted the S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. “For Q4 2020, aggregate increases amounted to $13.9 billion, up 64.2% from the $8.4 billion increase of Q3 2020 and up 15.7%, from Q4 2019’s $12.0 billion. Aggregate dividend cuts decreased 59.8% to $4.3 billion from Q3 2020’s $10.8 billion in cuts, and was up 221% from the $1.3 billion in cuts for Q4 2019.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Adding to the case for dividends in 2021 are recent dividend futures data, which, as Goldman Sachs notes, implies those contracts could bring cuts. But the bank says that’s a case of mispricing and that dividends should rise this year. 9 Stocks That Investors Think Are the Next Amazon With that opportunity ahead, here are some of the top dividend stocks to consider for 2021: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Western Union (NYSE:WU) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) VICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Dividend Stocks: Apple (AAPL) Source: View Apart / Shutterstock.com Apple’s dividend yields just 0.64%. In this environment of historically low interest rates and depressed yields, the company doesn’t standout on the basis of yield. However, it is one of the rare examples of a name that’s legitimately a growth stock with a solidified, growing dividend. In bygone eras of investing, technology companies didn’t rush to pay dividends because it was supposedly a sign that growth was behind them. That’s not the case with Apple. A relatively new participant in the dividend landscape, AAPL stock has consistently surged since it became a dividend payer less than a decade ago. As of Jan. 15, the company has a market capitalization of $2.15 trillion. The combination of 5G iPhone sales, a bigger push into high margins, revenue-steadying subscription-based services and its robust entertainment arm make Apple a top stock for 2021. For its most recent quarter, the company had $191.83 billion in cash on hand — more than enough to support and grow the dividend this year. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.com For a good portion of 2020, allocating to bank stocks, including JPMorgan Chase, tried investors’ patience. The group fell out of favor because of low interest rates, but that wasn’t all. Shareholder rewards (the one benefit of being involved with these names) suffered a blow when the Federal Reserve told the largest banks to scrap buybacks and that there would be no payout growth in 2020. Rather, JPMorgan had to set aside large sums of capital to cover bad loans due to the fragile Covid-19 economy. On that note, the sour loan situation didn’t turn out to be as bad as the Fed expected. That could mean at some point in 2021, JPMorgan and rivals will be allowed to repatriate that cash back into earnings. 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Growing Their Payouts There are reasons for optimism when it comes to the JPM stock dividend, including the Fed relenting on the buyback freeze last month. JPMorgan seized on that announcement, swiftly saying it will repurchase $30 billion of its shares. Western Union (WU) Source: apichon_tee/ShutterStock.com Dividend stocks are often associated with large- and mega-cap companies, but some smaller stocks have enviable payout track records. That group includes money-transfer provider Western Union. The company has a $8.95 billion market cap and yields 4.16%. This results in an annual payout of 90 cents per share, up from 24 cents a decade ago. WU stock was a sluggish performer last year, and its prosaic business doesn’t seem to jive with the current level of sexiness ascribed to the fintech revolution. But Western Union has digital capabilities of its own that could act as catalysts for the sleepy stock this year. “Expanding real-time payout capability is a key focus of the Company’s digital growth strategy which centers on growing its industry-leading digital services offered through westernunion.com and digital partnerships,” according to the company. “Together, the two growth drivers grew digital revenue 45% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2020, representing 21% of Western Union’s consumer business and trending at an annual rate of over $900 million.” Microsoft (MSFT) Source: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com Microsoft’s dividend history is longer than Apple’s. But they are both prime examples of growth companies that offer much more than just a dividend. Rather, they are growth names with the ability to support and grow the payout while delivering impressive levels of capital appreciation. While so many energy, consumer discretionary and real estate companies — just to name a few sectors — were cutting and halting dividends in 2020, Microsoft grew its payout. Last September, the tech giant raised its quarterly payout to 56 cents a share, a 10% increase. The company finished 2020 with $136.52 billion in cash on hand, so future dividend growth is easily supported. The Top 7 Marijuana Stocks to Buy for January Of course, Wall Street demands more of MSFT stock than dividend growth. And investors should, too. Fortunately, the company can execute. In the September quarter, Microsoft’s Azure cloud business, the second-largest of its kind, grew 48%. While the PC market could ebb a bit this year, Office 365, particularly the version including Teams, adds another growth driver for the company. VICI Properties (VICI) Source: Shutterstock Real estate investment trusts (REITs) were among the most egregious offenders when it came to dividend cuts in 2020. But VICI Properties didn’t get that memo, raising its payout 11% for its third consecutive hike. VICI is a gaming REIT, meaning it’s in the casino real estate business. To that end, it’s worth noting the company is the property owner of Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas strip, among dozens of other domestic gaming venues. However, investors should also note that Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR) is the REIT’s biggest client, and Caesars has a deep portfolio of regional casinos. Translation: VICI is significantly less Vegas-dependent than meets the eye. In fact, just about a quarter of its rental income was generated on the strip in the September quarter. VICI has some growth levers to pull as 2021 unfolds. Caesars is likely to divest several properties around the country to generate cash. VICI is the likely suitor for some of those venues, as it holds rights of first refusal for some assets on the strip. Additionally, VICI has served as partner for smaller casino operators looking to scoop regional venues, which leads to new rental income. Equinix (EQIX) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With a current price around $700, data-center REIT Equinix isn’t for everyone. EQIX is in the midst of a pullback that’s seen it retreat 17% from its 52-week high. But that could be a buying opportunity for investors. Data centers house servers and networking gear. And with cybersecurity and cloud-computing spending forecast to surge again this year, the case for EQIX stock remains strong. Plus, Equinix has recent history on its side, easily topping broader real estate benchmarks for five years. There are plenty of avenues for growth in 2021. 7 Hot Stocks That Will Keep You Energized With 3%-Plus Yields “Interconnection remains strong and, in our view, will continue to be the primary driver of Equinix’s continuing strength. The firm added eight new cloud on-ramps in the quarter, bringing its total to 160 and, resulting in a 42% market share in its footprint according to the company,” according to Morningstar. Texas Instruments (TXN) Source: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments is one of the original tech dividend names, initiating its payout in 1962. That’s ancient in tech dividend terms. More importantly, the payout grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% from 2004 to 2019. 2020 marked the 17th consecutive year in which the payout grew. Like many of its tech dividend counterparts, Texas Instruments has growth outlets despite being a mature company. Its battery management system (BMS) makes it a credible electric vehicle (EV) derivative play. The BMS is used by EV manufacturers to “reduce the complexity of their designs, improve reliability and reduce vehicle weight to extend driving range.” Design and extended range are two of the big hurdles that, if cleared, could rapidly speed EV adoption. There are more glamorous semiconductor stocks, but TXN is a way for conservative investors to get some EV exposure while getting compensated. That’s no small feat given the scarcity of dependable dividends in the EV arena.

3773d44b-8e47-36cd-ad16-c44d68546d4d;MSFT;With C3.ai Stock Down 22%, Investors Should Still Wait for Better;"When C3.ai (NYSE:AI) stock started trading in December, investors initially met shares with unprecedented demand. Prices jumped 300% within two weeks, giving AI stock the dubious award of “priciest tech stock” by Barron’s, a financial magazine. Source: Blackboard / Shutterstock Alas, such bullishness couldn’t last. C3.ai stock went on to lose a third of its value as investors reevaluated their options. With shares now at $138, is it time to pounce? The answer … is complicated. While AI stock is likely worth closer to $200 in the long run, its business model is poorly understood — despite its name, C3.ai is not actually an AI firm. That makes its shares risky: Hot-money investors will pull out when they realize the company will manage 40% to 70% annual growth, not 400% to 700%.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Still, C3.ai has one of the best technological platforms in the business. So even if you’re hesitant buying shares at $138, make sure you’re ready to back up that truck the moment the stock ever crosses below $100 again. AI Stock: Red Hat for the 21st Century To understand what C3.ai does, consider the variety of apps that power a work-from-home routine. You might start the day checking emails on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Outlook, then schedule meetings on Slack (NYSE:WORK) after logging sales calls on Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). All while trying to set up your toddler on a Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) playdate. 7 Dividend Stocks That Are Growing Their Payouts Even those who don’t use software regularly all have the shared experience of some obtuse HR software that tells you, “your username wasn’t found in our system.” (But I work here!) It’s a tangle of software providers that rarely work together. C3.ai seeks to solve that problem for enterprise data. Founded in 2009 by veteran Silicon Valley billionaire Thomas M. Siebel, the firm packages various open-source software under a single umbrella. The final product, known as the C3.ai Suite, allows companies to use a single data-management platform. Rather than stitching together dozens of providers themselves, companies can exclusively use C3.ai to collect, distribute and analyze information. It’s not the first time a company has repackaged open-source software for enterprise use. RedHat, founded in 1993, put professional programmers (and a reasonably strong sales team) behind a new operating system Linux, which now runs 90% of public cloud computing services. And more recently, the Cloudera/Hortonworks (NYSE:CLDR) merger has worked to bring Hadoop, a powerful open-source data-networking tool, to enterprise clients. C3.ai, however, takes this a step further. It’s become arguably the best one-stop shop for companies seeking a unified data platform by including no fewer than 17 dimensions in its software suite. And according to an independent analysis by ZDNet, a business technology publication, two core patents at the company solve a long-standing issue of integrating Hadoop into enterprise software. So, even though the C3.ai Suite doesn’t focus on cutting-edge artificial intelligence, it provides the tools needed to run the massive computing power that AI and machine learning need. Growing Pains at C3.ai C3.ai isn’t without its faults. Most problematically, the company is an unabashedly technology-first, sales-second company. No salespeople sit on their executive team. And its lackluster sales performance means that the company’s top-three customers now produce almost 50% of total revenues. Growth has also slowed — the company saw just 11% revenue growth in the six months ending October 2020. These signs point to the same problem: the company needs a higher-quality sales operation. For most high-tech startups, adding a sales team is often a terrifying thought — what high-brow development team wants to “dirty” their ranks with smooth-talking salespeople? But even the highest-quality software won’t sell itself in the competitive B2B (business-to-business) world. Enterprises know that software switching costs are monumental. Most won’t switch services without a firm push from a good sales team. C3.ai has begun to solve this problem. In the past six months, the company more than doubled the stock-based compensation to its sales and marketing team. It’s a necessary first step, but the company still needs to find a winning sales formula to capitalize on its low marginal costs. AI Stock: What Is It Worth? The work-in-progress company has thrown Wall Street analysts into a virtual shouting match. The most bearish of all, J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy, issued a $84 price target on the stock. This suggests a 40% downside. Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives gave the company a $200 price target — creating a gap wide enough to sail a cruise liner through. In the short term, the truth is somewhere in between. C3.ai desperately needs to nurture its sales team with better management and incentives beyond generous stock options. Without that, the company will likely miss the 14.5% sequential growth that analysts expect, dragging its price to a range of $100 to $120. Longer term, however, C3.ai looks like a clear winner. Its hidden weapon, an enterprise-friendly packaging of Hadoop, is a keystone to any company that wants analytics, machine learning and AI capabilities. That includes everything from catching bank fraud to optimizing supply chains. And as the necessity for data analytics grows, so too will demand for the company’s products. Investors should observe; though the AI stock price looks weak today, it’s a long-term winner among the SaaS companies.

eff4360e-41dd-3aae-8e83-def433ef7f4a;NFLX;Numbers Game For Netflix: Subscriber Growth, Pace Of New Content, New Streaming Competition;"Much of 2020 was a numbers game for Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), which raked in an amazing amount of new subscribers as people waited out the pandemic in front of their big-screen TVs. These numbers return to focus Tuesday after the bell, when NFLX reports Q4 earnings.No one wants to call anything a ""winner"" during a pandemic that has impacted so many lives and battered the business models of so many companies, but NFLX and other streaming services like it arguably became the ""comfort foods"" that many turned to.After NFLX added more than 28.3 million new subscribers to an already hefty base in the first three quarters of 2020, analysts are anxious to hear how the streaming giant ended the year from a subscriber standpoint. NFLX executives have been warning all along that subscribers added in the first half of 2020 represented an unsustainable pull-forward of the quarantined masses. How could anyone expect the streaming video veteran to continue bringing in new subscribers to the tune of 16 million in Q1 and 10.1 million in Q2 on a regular basis?Certainly not NFLX execs, as was confirmed in Q3 when a relatively small 2.2 million added their names to the NFLX subscriber list. So many other would-be subscribers were said to be spending their summers outdoors as--wrongly, it turns out--it appeared the contagion was getting under control.As some cities pulled in the reins again in Q4, did NFLX see another subscriber surge? During the Q3 conference call, Chief Executive Reed Hastings predicted the year would end with more than 200 million members on the rolls.""Next time we get together,"" he said on the pre-recorded Q3 conference call, ""we should be over 200 million members...we've got an amazing content technology and marketing engine humming,"" he added. ""So really looking forward to next year.""Many analysts appear to be too, considering how many have reiterated their ""buy"" ratings on the stock ahead of earnings.Since bottoming in March, NFLX stock is up nearly 70%--and that includes the 6% it's lost since the beginning of 2021.FIGURE 1: UPSTREAMING. Shares of Netflix (NFLX--candlestick) handily outpaced the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX--purple line in 2020). Can it keep its mojo in 2021 amid increasing competition? Data sources: Nasdaq, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.Priming The Pump Talk about breaking the mold: Only a week ahead of its earnings release, NFLX went against its typical low-key rules and released a fast-paced trailer with three super Hollywood stars unveiling its 70-movie slate for 2021.In a rapid, engrossing video hosted by Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson, the streaming video giant--the industry's largest and still growing--rolled out short-clip previews of a wide array of movies that will feature such big-name Hollywood stars as Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leonardo DiCaprio, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams, Benedict Cumberbatch and Idris Elba, among other star-studded actors for this year.View more earnings on NFLXAt 70, that's a new movie--and then some--per week. In short, it underscored what The New York Times called ""a reminder of its power in a Hollywood that has been irrevocably changed during the pandemic.""That might be pushing the envelope, but it appears to give credence to the role streaming video powerhouses like NFLX, Disney+ (NYSE: DIS), Amazon.com, Inc's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video and other streamers are taking on as movie theaters lose their mojo. Original programming looks to be going a long way into the TV rooms of many U.S. households.A Breaking Point? One of NFLX's challenges with so much content is that it overwhelms subscribers, according to analysts. With so many choices and so many you've-got-to-see-this recommendations, besieged subscribers don't know where to turn and sometimes choose something else altogether.Or as Jeff Loucks, executive director at Deloitte, said in a recent cord-cutting study: ""Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, streaming services have attracted more subscribers than ever. The biggest challenge for providers will likely be to retain customers once their series is over and the full price kicks in.""NFLX brought out Netflix Direct to meet the challenge. In November, NFLX started testing it in France as a means of making the choices for subscribers through a more linear programming version, akin to the traditional network TV channel experience. It's a StopTheScroll concept Vulture.com said could help NFLX retain viewers who might get lost in the glut of content by giving them regular programming day-to-day that algorithms determine might be of interest to them. Yes, it's a throwback but sometimes nostalgia is good and analysts said they want to know how good.Speaking Of Numbers        In Q4, NFLX hiked prices in the U.S., Canada and Ireland, and, after the quarter ended, in the U.K.. Some analysts expect widespread pricing increases again in 2021.""Netflix always characterizes (its) approach to price as seeking to earn the right to raise price by earning engagement from their members, and always seeking to make sure the value perceived by members far exceeds the price they are asked to pay,"" Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger said in a note to clients this week. ""On that basis, it's hard to argue that Netflix hasn't earned the right to raise prices by $1/$2.""It's unlikely NFLX execs will talk about that on the pre-recorded call, but analysts said they will be parsing all comments for any insight into pricing ahead. Higher prices typically lead to higher churn as subscribers lose their enthusiasm on the value quotient. At the same time, however, it could still lead to better revenues.The Marketing Measure NFLX has long been known to throw the spaghetti against the wall as it tries out ways to lure viewers in and keep them interested. The latest is a big tweak to the ""most viewed list,"" which could be considered the equivalent of the candy dish at your grandmother's house: Whenever you're there, you always go back to see what's in it that you might want to try next.Analysts are talking about how NFLX execs have said they plan to expand the list to 50 entries from the original 10 and want to know more. What else is on the boards to limit churn as prices climb?Closer To Free Cash Flow? Reed noted free cash flow on the call, and Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann wasn't shy when talking about the potential $2 billion in free cash flow over 2020 and how it's tracking toward improved profitability and a reduction in content spend.Here's what he said on the call: ""We're not yet sustainably free cash-flow positive or ready to call that, but we're rapidly closing in, and then, say, given the more than $8 billion of cash on the balance sheet, we are at a point where at least--you could probably pretty safely say--we can self-finance our growth without needing to access the capital markets. But we're still, obviously based on our guidance, probably a couple of years away, at least from sustainably being free cash flow positive.""""Self-finance our growth..."" That could be a biggie--it's the challenge faced by many of today's so-called ""disruptors"" who, at some point, must rely less on narrative and more on profitability.

a78141fa-5ebb-353f-a648-fbcbf36a075d;WISH;J.P. Morgan Predicts 30%-Plus Rally for These 2 Stocks;"Basic physics, and the evidence of our own eyes, tells us that what goes up must come down. But the NASDAQ is over 13,000, and the S&amp;P 500 is over 3,800, and some market watchers are starting to wonder where the ceiling is. Banking giant JPMorgan investigates that question, seeking to find out just how much room the bulls have left to run in the current market conditions.Looking back to the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the financial crisis of 2008, the bank’s global markets strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou notes that, among stocks, bonds, and cash, the average equity holding has been 42.3%. He points out that this ‘neutral’ level was breach in November, and equity allocations now are nearer 43.8%.This increase from the average would imply that there may not be much room for stocks to keep going up – except that the post-Lehman equity allocation high, reached in January 2018, was 47.6%. To state the obvious, we’re not there yet. Panigirtzoglou sees the ongoing expansion of the M2 monetary base fueling the stock boom, and insulating it from changes in the bond markets.Against this backdrop, JPMorgan analysts are pounding the table on two stocks in particular, noting that each could surge over 30% in the year ahead. We ran the the two through TipRanks database to see what other Wall Street's analysts have to say about them. ContextLogic (WISH)We will start with ContextLogic, the parent company of Wish.com. This e-commerce marketplace has become known for its social media ads, both for their ubiquitous presence and their entertainment value. Wish has a knack for drawing traffic and customers – it has become the third-largest online retail site it the US, with over 100 million monthly visitors and more than 150 million items listed for sale. The company’s revenue exceeds $2 billion annually.The company's growth is being driven by several factors: the high monthly traffic, the large – and largely untapped – e-commerce customer base of low-income households looking for budget goods, and worldwide network of more than 500 million merchants.WISH ran up a great deal of hype in December, when it held its IPO – and saw the price drop nearly 17% in the first trading day. The offering was priced at $24 per share, but the stock closed its first day trading at $20.05. Even so, the company still raised $1.1 billion in its first day on the market, and currently boasts a market cap of $14.5 billion.Covering the stock for JPM, 5-star analyst Doug Anmuth wrote: ""We believe Wish has significant growth potential with current penetration of ~3% of the global target market estimated at 1B+ households, and less than 1% share of the overall $2.1T global mobile commerce market. Wish utilizes data science to drive all aspects of its business from user acquisition to pricing to logistics, which helps the company stay nimble and should drive greater global scale over time. We expect Wish to deliver more consistent 20s%+ growth over the next couple years…”To this end, Anmuth rates WISH an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $30 price target implies a 43% upside potential for the next 12 months. (To watch Anmuth’s track record, click here)Wall Street is quite positive on this 'Moderate Buy' stock: WISH has received 8 'buy' and 4 'hold' ratings in the last three months. Running the numbers across the Street, the 12-month average price target lands at $26, representing about 24% upside potential. (See WISH stock analysis on TipRanks)Passage Bio (PASG)The second JPM pick we’re looking at is Passage Bio, a genetic medicines company. Passage is focused on developing treatments for rare, life-threatening, monogenic central nervous system disorders, using an adeno-associated virus delivery system. Monogenic disorders are caused by a mutation or defect in a single gene; the adeno-associated virus system is tailored to deliver a corrected gene directly into affected cells.The company currently has three main drug candidates under development: PBGM01, a treatment for GM1 gangliosidosis; PBFT02, to treat frontotemporal dementia; and PBKR03 as a treatment for Krabbe disease. All three are in the IND-enabling phase of the development cycle, and the company announced earlier this month that PBGM01 has received FDA approval to advance to Phase 1/2 trial. PBFT02 and PBKR03 are both scheduled to initiate Phase 1/2 later in 1H20. The upbeat outlook for Passage’s research program underlies the JPM stance on the stock. 5-star analyst Anupam Rama has upgraded his firm’s rating from Neutral to Overweight and set a price target of $35, indicating a potential ~34% upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Rama’s track record, click here)Backing his upgrade, Rama notes the FDA clearance on PBGM01 and writes, “[We] expect focus to return to the upcoming GM1 data mid-year, which will represent the key initial clinical catalyst for the company. Based on known pre-clinical data, we would look for the initial PBGM01 GM1 data to not only de-risk the program itself but also the company’s broader platform.”The analyst consensus on PASG is not unanimous, but almost. The Strong Buy consensus rating is supported by 3 Buys against a single Hold. Shares sell for $26.25, and the average price target of $32.83 indicates an upside of ~25%.

5a75a51d-5cc0-37aa-b371-b9f50b8a6612;WISH;Wish, the Online Dollar Store, Is Losing Momentum Before IPO;(Bloomberg) -- A global pandemic should theoretically be perfect timing for an e-commerce company to go public because homebound shoppers have fueled a record-breaking surge in online sales.At least that’s what Wish.com is counting on.In a filing last week, the upstart web store best known for cheap trinkets shipped direct from China said it plans to sell 46 million shares for $22 to $24 each, which would value the company at up to $17 billion on a fully diluted basis. Wish, which is expected to price Tuesday and start trading the following day, could get a lift from the successful public offerings of tech industry counterparts DoorDash Inc. and Airbnb Inc., both of which popped out of the gate.But analysts say there are already signs that Wish, which posted a net loss of $176 million for the first nine months of this year, is losing momentum despite spending heavily on ads to attract customers. Even more worrying, they say, is a recent hike in postal rates between China and the U.S. that could push up the company’s costs.“They’re underperforming the e-commerce market both in the U.S. and Europe,” says Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of the research firm Marketplace Pulse. “That, to me, is a concern.”A Wish spokeswoman declined to make Chief Executive Officer Peter Szulczewski available for an interview, citing the pre-IPO quiet period.The origins of Wish, officially known as ContextLogic Inc., go back to 2010, when Szulczewski and co-founder Danny Zhang started an online advertising company. When that failed to take off, Szulczewski hit on another idea: invitint Chinese merchants to sell cheap products directly to U.S. buyers. The timing was propitious because the community of sellers supplying e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. were now looking for opportunities abroad. Szulczewski renamed the company Wish.com and in late 2012 began hiring Chinese staff to recruit sellers and handle customer service.Wish grew so quickly in the early years that it attracted the attention of Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos. Typically, when a potential rival emerges, the Seattle giant strikes up a relationship with the upstart, the better to get a look under the hood and maybe even see if it’s worth acquiring. Szulczewski and Zhang were invited to Seattle, where they spent the day describing their vision. The pair got the impression that Amazon executives didn’t think much of their business model. But when Wish continued to grow quickly, Szulczewski was invited to sit down with Bezos. A suspicious Szulczewski declined the meeting and continued to build his company, raising $1.8 billion from investors including GGV Capital, Joe Lonsdale’s 8VC and Founders Fund. (Zhang left Wish last year.)Scrolling through Wish’s feed today, shoppers see a smattering of products, from $8 AirPod knockoffs to 50-cent baby dolls. The items have little in common, except that they’re dirt cheap.Katie Plummer is an Amazon Prime subscriber but sometimes finds herself on Wish buying random items -- mostly for her dogs.Earlier this year, Plummer, 34, bought flashing lights for 95 cents to clip onto her mutt Stanley’s collar, so she can see him during nighttime walks. Then she bought a dog whistle and a $2 seat belt to keep the 35-pound pooch from flying out of the car. Plummer didn’t mind that it took months for Wish to deliver the items to her home in Concord, North Carolina.“Amazon is convenient,” she says. “Wish is more of a dollar store on your phone.”Wish generates about 70% of its sales from impulse buyers, not from searches for specific items, according to a filing. That could be a problem, says Forrester retail analyst Sucharita Kodali, who notes that Wish isn’t entirely comparable to dollar stores, which sell such essentials as groceries that pull people in regularly. And unlike Amazon, she says, Wish doesn’t sell everything.“It’s random tchotchkes,” she says. “It’s cell-phone accessories and skirts. It’s not everything for all people. It’s not even some things for some people.”Despite the stampede online this year, Wish said third-quarter core marketplace revenue -- which includes commissions collected from merchants -- increased 17% compared with the same period last year. That trails the 37% growth in U.S. e-commerce sales during the same period, as logged by the Commerce Department.In its IPO filing, Wish attributed the “moderated” third-quarter revenue growth to pandemic-related issues that slowed deliveries and prompted fewer shoppers to click the buy button. That could be a sign that while Wish’s customers are willing to tolerate extended shipping windows, there is a limit to how long they are willing to wait. It took an average of 62 days for U.S. customers to receive their Wish orders in the second quarter, compared with just 27 days in the first three months of the year. Shipping times improved last quarter, falling to 22 days on average.Meanwhile, sales and marketing expenses are a considerable burden, costing Wish $1.1 billion in the first nine months of this year, or 64% of its $1.7 billion in revenue. And while the company spent a greater percentage of revenue, 78%, on marketing for all of 2019, a company filing acknowledged that these expenses will continue to comprise a majority of operating costs for the foreseeable future.“They are quite literally buying sales,” Kaziukenas says. “I don’t know where that goes in the future, as Facebook and other marketing channels become more expensive. That’s a channel that will continue to eat into any sort of profitability.”For years, Wish benefited from low shipping rates through the Universal Postal Union Treaty, which subsidizes small packages from China. The company notes in the IPO filing that the hike in rates that took effect in July are likely to increase its shipping costs. Unless Wish begins bringing more products wholesale into the U.S. and Europe, it could be difficult to continue selling so many items for less than $5, says Kaziukenas, who researches online marketplaces.Last year, the company launched Wish Local, which lets customers pick up orders from nearby brick-and-mortar retailers. (The stores can sell through Wish, too.) In an interview with Forbes in July, Szulczewski said, “If you think about it, Walmart has about a billion square feet of retail space. If we have a million stores sign up for our service with about 1,000 square feet per store on average, we have a virtual Walmart.” So far, about 50,000 stores have signed on, according to the IPO filing.Ordering from Wish is far from perfect, according to Plummer, the North Carolinian customer. She ordered two “dog mom” key chains in April for 95 cents. They never showed up, so she got a refund in September. She has tried the local pickup option and hit some snags. Her most recent Wish order was a pair of earrings priced at $1 on Oct. 19. She selected a nearby computer store as her pickup location.But because Wish orders take so long to arrive, Plummer usually forgets about them -- which is a problem because Wish gives customers only 15 days to pick them up.

d0bccc75-d296-3dbe-92e8-5eae7fd5c086;WISH;Airbnb Valuation Reaches $100 Billion in Trading Debut Surge;(Bloomberg) -- Airbnb Inc. shares more than doubled in their trading debut, propelling the home-rental company to about a $100 billion valuation and one of the biggest first-day rallies on record.The shares closed Thursday at $144.71 up 113% from the $68 initial public offering price. The listing came 10 months after the Covid-19 pandemic upended travel and 24 hours after DoorDash Inc. soared in its public debut.Airbnb joined DoorDash in what is quickly becoming a euphoric moment for new listings in America’s equity markets, egged on by retail investors embracing companies poised to thrive as vaccines promise a loosening of pandemic restrictions.While soaring valuations for IPOs give many market veterans pause, Airbnb, while unprofitable on an annual basis, made money in the third quarter as it cut costs. Out of 200 firms that went public this year, 80% have yet to earn money on an annual basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“I don’t know what else to say,” Airbnb Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky said in an earlier Bloomberg Television interview, when indications showed the stock could open at more than $139 per share. “I’m very humbled by it.”Airbnb’s market value, based on its outstanding shares, makes it the world’s biggest online travel company. Its $86.5 billion market value narrowly tops Booking Holdings Inc.’s $86.2 billion market capitalization, and eclipses Expedia Group Inc. and TripAdvisor Inc. Airbnb’s market value, about 19 or 20 times its 2021 revenue at the opening price Thursday, also topped that of the four largest public hotel chains combined.San Francisco-based Airbnb’s fully diluted valuation is even higher, around $100 billion including employee stock options and restricted stock units.‘Resilient’ ModelAlfred Lin, a Sequoia Capital partner who sits on the boards of both Airbnb and DoorDash, said the past two days have been a blur. Strong investor demand shows investors recognize Airbnb’s potential, he said.“We’ve seen how resilient this business model is and we’ve seen the company stare into the abyss of a pandemic that shut down global travel and figure their way out of it,” Lin said.DoorDash’s debut surge -- elevating its fully diluted value to about $71 billion -- played a role in Airbnb’s discussion about pricing its IPO above the marketed range, according to people familiar with the matter. An Airbnb representative declined to comment.To hang on to its lofty valuation, Airbnb will need to grapple with a litany of threats, as outlined in its IPO prospectus, ranging from a surge in party houses that carry liability risks to an increase in professionally run properties that lack the charm that made Airbnb rentals famous.IPO RecordAirbnb and DoorDash propelled IPO volume to all-time high for December, surpassing the $8.3 billion mark set for the month in both 2001 and 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.There’s more to come. Other consumer-facing web-based companies set to go public this month include video-game company Roblox Corp., installment loans provider Affirm Holdings Inc. and ContextLogic Inc., the parent of online discount retailer Wish Inc. Those listings will add to what is already a record year for IPOs, with more than $167 billion raised on U.S. exchanges, including Airbnb and DoorDash, the data show.Airbnb’s offering was led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Its shares trade on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol ABNB.Pandemic CrushSan Francisco-based Airbnb has seen a bounce back in domestic bookings since the early days of the pandemic crushed demand.“No year in our history has been as wild and crazy and defining as this year,” Chesky said in an earlier interview, from the original Airbnb apartment on Rausch Street in San Francisco where the idea for the company was born in 2007.In the past 13 years, Airbnb has totally upended the travel market, given people an opportunity for income and created a whole new market for services related to real estate and hosts.The company’s IPO plans were put on hold in March as the pandemic ground global travel to a halt. By April, room bookings and experiences had plunged 72%. Airbnb rolled out a blanket refund policy and doled out more than $1 billion in cancellation fees.By June, though, things were starting to look up. City dwellers who were sick of being stuck inside their homes got in their cars and drove to mountain towns and rural communities, often setting up for weeks or months at a time as work-from-home policies allowed.Domestic BoostInternational travel was down, but demand for domestic, short-distance trips and stays outside of the top 20 cities proved resilient.In the third quarter, Airbnb’s revenue declined only 18%, compared to the near 60% decline for Expedia and Marriott International Inc. The three-month period was also Airbnb’s most profitable ever when adjusted for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.For the first nine months of 2020, Airbnb had a net loss of $697 million on revenue of $2.5 billion, compared with a net loss of $323 million on revenue of $3.7 billion for the same period last year, according to its filings.Reid Hoffman, of early Airbnb investor Greylock Partners, credited the company’s leadership with steering the company through the pandemic crisis. That included making difficult decisions to refund guests while providing partial payments to hosts, even though that had the painful consequence of laying off 25% of its employees, he said.“Today, Airbnb is thriving, and when effective vaccines are broadly available, it will no doubt adapt to those changed circumstances as well,” Hoffman said.Founders’ ControlAirbnb’s four classes of stock give holders of its Class B -- with 20 votes each compared to one each for the Class A shares sold in the IPO -- control of the company.Chesky, with co-founders Nathan Blecharczyk and Joseph Gebbia, will have 42.9% of the company’s voting power, according to its filings. Sequoia Capital will have 16.4% of the voting power, the filings show.Another early investor in both Airbnb and DoorDash, Ron Conway, distinguished current market enthusiasm and valuations from the dot.com bubble era two decades ago.“It’s not like the last bubble where you had companies that were two years old with no revenues getting a $20 billion market cap,” said Conway. “You have companies that are 10 years old with very significant revenues.”(Updates with details in third paragraph on Airbnb’s third-quarter financials)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.;Fri, 11 Dec 2020 19:16:04 +0000;WISH_2020-12-11;0.955;0.0516
8b7f8eaa-6eaa-37f8-b528-73cffe1d0771;WISH;DoorDash’s 92% Jump Adds to Blistering Year for Unicorn IPOs;(Bloomberg) -- Shares of unprofitable food delivery platform DoorDash Inc. surged as much as 92% in their trading debut Wednesday, in the latest sign of investor exuberance in what has already been a record year for IPOs.DoorDash, which has seized on the pandemic-fueled boom in demand for meals brought to your door, saw its shares climb as high as $195.50 in New York after raising $3.37 billion in its initial public offering. The first-day jump, the third biggest this year in the U.S. for a large IPO, gives DoorDash a market capitalization of $60 billion and a fully-diluted value of $71.3 billion -- higher than companies including Kraft Heinz Co., Lululemon Athletica Inc. and Ford Motor Co.Investors looked past concerns that competition from rivals such as Uber Technologies Inc. may heat up next year, just as the distribution of vaccines reduces the need for at-home dining. DoorDash’s surge also bodes well for companies such as Airbnb Inc. that are looking to add to the more than $160 billion already raised by IPOs in 2020.DoorDash’s shares opened at $182 after the company priced them at $102 each. They closed at $189.51, almost 86% higher than the listing price.The IPO is the third-largest on a U.S. exchange this year, exceeded only by the $4 billion blank-check company backed by billionaire Bill Ackman and software maker Snowflake Inc.’s $3.86 billion offering including so-called greenshoe shares.DoorDash had 50% of U.S. market share as of October, surging past UberEats, GrubHub and Postmates, according to its filing documents. That number is up from just 17% in January 2018. DoorDash said there is also an opportunity for that market to expand, with fewer than 6% of U.S. residents currently using its service. Revenue in the first nine months of the year more than tripled and its net loss narrowed from a year earlier on a surge in new customers, the company said.Some skeptics don’t expect the increase in at-home dining to last.“As we go from being stuck at home to wanting to venture out, people are less likely to want to go and order delivery,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors. “They’re going to want to actually go out and go to a restaurant.”He added that the market could also get more competitive, especially as rival Uber sees a pickup in its ride-sharing business, which could help subsidize its food delivery investment.Restaurant FeesWhile DoorDash helped many restaurants stay afloat as pandemic lockdowns forced them into a takeout-only model, the fees that it charges, which can be 30% of the cost of an order, are seen as unfair by some eateries. Certain cities, including New York and Seattle, have set limits on the amount of fees delivery services can charge restaurants.The company started by doing deliveries in Palo Alto, California, where Tony Xu and his two co-founders were students at Stanford University. They often did the deliveries themselves in the evenings after classes.“It’s certainly surreal,” Xu said Wednesday in a Bloomberg TV interview, recalling the early days when he was “delivering hummus out of my Honda.”Including DoorDash, companies have now raised more than $160 billion in IPOs on U.S. exchanges this year, an all-time high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Several more are expected before the end of the year as companies that put off listing plans during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic regain the confidence to put their shares on public markets.The next-largest of the group is home-rental platform Airbnb, which is seeking to raise as much as $3.09 billion in its IPO Wednesday. Others include video-game company Roblox Corp., installment loans provider Affirm Holdings Inc. and ContextLogic Inc., the parent of online discount retailer Wish Inc.Just two companies that raised more than $1 billion saw a bigger pop in their shares in their U.S. trading debut, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese online real estate platform KE Holdings Inc. climbed 87% in its first trading session, while shares of cloud computing company Snowflake Inc. more than doubled on day one.MORE: DoorDash Trio Worth Up to $2.7 Billion Each as IPO SoarsBefore the pandemic, food-delivery companies like DoorDash and rivals Uber Eats and Grubhub Inc. struggled to make money amid fierce competition among themselves and blowback over their fees and treatment of workers. Margins in the business are razor thin, prompting a wave of consolidation that saw Grubhub agree in June to get bought by Just Eat Takeaway.com NV for $7.3 billion, and Uber acquire Postmates Inc. for $2.65 billion in an all-stock deal in July.DoorDash’s offering is being led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., with Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, RBC Capital Markets and UBS Group AG also on the deal. DoorDash’s shares are trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DASH.(Closes shares in fourth paragraph.

6b60f251-0192-3c4a-9bbb-edbee82141cb;FEYE;Unusual Options Activity Insight: FireEye;"FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved up to $23.06 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-12-24  * Strike Price: $21.00  * Volume: 631  * Open Interest: 1660Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

55156272-0cfb-31c2-8708-60a0ae904306;FEYE;PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: FireEye;Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session.On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel.A stock can be stuck in a trading range for quite some time until it has a catalyst for making a move higher or lower. Although it may have some price fluctuations after earrings reports or rating changes, it will only revert back to its prior trading range.One such issue that is finally making a major move is FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE) and is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day.The Dog Of Dogs In Cybersecurity Sector: FireEye made its all-time high in March 2014 at $97.35 and backed off sharply to end that month at $61.57. The following month it shed another $20, swooning to $39.37. Six years later, the issue is roughly half of the price as it trades at the $20 level.In comparison, peer ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) has rallied from its month-end close in April 2014 ($49.72) to $545. You do the math on which issue has performed better.Nauseating Trading Range: From February 2016 through today, FireEye has primarily been in a trading range ($11.35 to $20.61). The majority of the price action has taken place in the $13-$16 area.The bottom of the range was breached in March 2017 when it bottomed at $10.35. Its ultimate low was made in April at $9.26. That was substantially lower than its IPO price of $40.Recent Price Action: After hovering at the upper end of the $13-16 range for a few weeks, the issue was tagged on Dec. 9, falling from $15.52 to $13.49 on much heavier than average volume, The reason being the company reported it was hacked by a foreign government and internal tools were accessed.Over the next five days, all of its daily lows were from the $13.27-$13.53 range. Off that base, it was able to rally to $14.38 by the end of last Thursday's session.In Friday's session, the issue caught a major bid for once with related issues in the sector. The thought process of investors being an overall increase in spending in response to the unprecedented damage from the cyberattacks had on SolarWinds (NYSE: SWI) rumored to have been orchestrated by Russia.At this time, SolarWinds has been unable to mount a substantial rebound off its decline from $24 to $14 as it trades at the $16 area.Moving Forward: Interestingly, FireEye's wicked two-day rally has so far come to an end in a very familiar area, just above the top of its four-year trading range ($20.61), peaking at $20.81. As of 1:30 p.m. ET, it fallen near the $20.30 level.Bulls of the issue will view the retreat from the high as some profit-taking from its recent monster rally. After the profit-taking subsidies, it will clear the $21 area and move towards its January 2016 high ($22.48) and beyond.Bears are assuming Fireye will just do what it has done over the past four years and retreat to at least the top of the former trading range at the $16 area or lower.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Rocket Companies  * PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Pfizer(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

ea85b8d1-869c-3cbe-9bfe-e0489bf8cddc;XPEV;XPeng To Roll Out Autonomous Driving Feature For Highways;"Chinese electric vehicle company XPeng announced the launch of a new autonomous driving feature tailored for use on highways as the competition in the EV market heats up. XPeng (XPEV) unveiled the beta version of its NGP (Navigation Guided Pilot) highway autonomous driving solution this week as part of a series of road test drives in Guangzhou. The company seeks to launch the NGP function, as a key part of its XPILOT 3.0 autonomous driving package, to customers in China in the next few weeks. XPeng’s NGP highway navigation feature enables automatic navigation assisted driving from point A to B based on the navigation route and allows drivers to automatically change lanes, speed up or slow down, or overtake cars and enter and exit highways. Initially, the feature will be deployed in the Premium version of XPeng’s flagship P7 sedan equipped with the XPILOT 3.0 system. “XPeng’s NGP solution has been specifically created and tailored for China’s complex driving environment. Its full-scenario high-definition positioning capability solves HD-map positioning challenges for China’s highly complex road conditions, including areas with no GPS signals,” XPeng said in a statement. “It can identify and avoid traffic cones, warn of difficult situations such as construction sites or road toll entrances, follow on automatically in traffic jams, avoid breakdown vehicles, change lanes to avoid emergencies, avoid large trucks, and warn drivers of when to resume manual control in dangerous situations such as adverse weather or road accidents.” According to XPeng, the P7 is China’s only mass production car with 360-degree dual camera and radar fusion perception system for added safety. It is equipped with 14 cameras, 5 millimeter-wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and Nvidia’s Xavier system-on-the-chip computing platform. XPeng has been ramping up its cash coffers in recent months. The EV maker last week secured a $2 billion credit line. In December, the company raised about $2.5 billion by selling American depositary shares (ADS) at $45 a piece in what marked the first public follow-on offering since its initial public offering (IPO) in August 2020. The fund raising comes as the Chinese EV maker is working on developing its international strategy following the launch of its first production model in Norway. As part of the global strategy, the EV maker is planning to roll out its second production model, the P7 electric sports sedan, in Europe within the next 12 months. The company delivered a total of 27,041 vehicles in 2020 and has a customer base of over 40,000. XPEV, which began trading on the New York Stock Exchange after its $1.7 billion IPO at a price of $15 per ADS, closed 5% lower at $47.82 on Jan. 15. (See XPEV stock analysis on TipRanks) Merrill Lynch analyst Ming-Hsun Lee recently reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $54.10 price target as he expects XPeng to launch additional autonomous features to lure more consumers, which in turn will help accelerate volume sales. XPEV has picked up 5 Buys, 1 Hold, and 1 Sell which add up to a Moderate Buy analyst consensus. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at $50.62, implying 5.9% upside potential over the coming year. What's more, XPEV scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks' Smart Score ranking, indicating indicating that it has a strong chance of beating market expectations.

07b329d6-402b-3269-8db0-f68ad4b93de3;XPEV;XPeng: Here’s What You Need to Know About the New LiDAR Supplier;Last November, XPeng (XPEV) said it intends to integrate 2 LiDARs into its sensor suite which will be used for the Chinese electric vehicle maker’s 3rd model - a compact sedan. The company will begin incorporating them later this year.However, who the LiDAR supplier would be was unknown until now. XPeng has just revealed that the hardware will be supplied by China-based Livox.Livox is a relatively new company which in 2016 was spun off from leading drone maker DJI. The LiDAR will be manufactured at the company’s new automotive-grade plant and customized for XPeng specs, with capacity anticipated to reach 100,000 pieces per year per line.Livox has adjusted its Horiz sensor for improved performance so it can meet the required automotive grade standards. Horiz’ detection range will therefore increase from 90m in the public sample version to 150m should provide XPeng’s ADAS system XPILOT with faster object recognition both on highways and urban roads.When comparing its lidar to a rival, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu believes XPeng made certain considerations when choosing the supplier.“Livox’s LiDAR uses Time of Flight (ToF) architecture and 905nm wavelength with performance that appears lower than Luminar’s Iris, suggesting to us XPeng may be optimizing for time-to-market and cost,” the analyst said.The company hasn’t provided pricing yet, but Yu believes the cost will be less than $800 per unit and as the car will be a mid-tier vehicle rather than a typical top of the range luxury sedan, it “could potentially be sub $500.”XPeng management has said the quality of its system’s horizontal and vertical position identification and spatial resolution will benefit from LiDAR. Furthermore, ambient light does not affect LiDAR’s perception capabilities.To this end, Yu rates XPEV a Buy and his $58 price target suggests possible upside of 37% over the coming months. (To watch Yu’s track record, click here)The rest of the Street also remains in XPeng’s corner. Based on 6 Buys and 1 Sell and Hold, each, the analyst consensus is a Moderate Buy. The forecast is for 12% of upside in the year ahead, given the average price target clocks in at $46.35.

For investors expecting that momentum to continue in 2021, Bank of America analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith has named seven stocks that are set to benefit from what he calls the ""triple crown"" of renewable energy tax credits in play in 2021.Tax Credit Triple Crown: First, based on the text of the latest stimulus bill, the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) will remain at 26% through the end of 2022.""This incremental extension comes sooner than expected and likely drives upside to solar growth in the out years (albeit limited near-term impacts),"" Dumoulin-Smith wrote in a note.See Also: Clean Energy Fuels Lands 2 New Deals, Could Also Benefit From New AdministrationHe named Sunnova Energy International Inc (NYSE: NOVA), Sunrun Inc (NASDAQ: RUN) and SunPower Corporation (NASDAQ: SPWR) as the three stocks that will benefit the most from the solar tax credit extension.Second, the Onshore Wind Production Tax Credit (PTC) will remain at 60% if construction begins before the end of 2021. Dumoulin-Smith named NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE: NEE) and Avangrid Inc (NYSE: AGR) as the two biggest winners from this extension.Finally, the offshore wind ITC/PTC has been extended by five years, meaning any company that begins project construction by the end of 2025 qualifies for either a 30%ITC or PTC. Dumoulin-Smith said investors should expect most companies to opt for the ITC and said Acangrid, Eversource Energy (NYSE: ES) and Dominion Energy Inc (NYSE: D) will be major beneficiaries.Benzinga's Take: Just because these clean energy stocks will benefit from the ""triple crown"" of tax credits in 2021 doesn't mean all of them are great investments after big runs in 2020. Of the seven stocks mentioned, Bank of America only has Buy ratings on Dominion, NextEra and SunRun.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Will Tesla Destabilize The S&amp;P 500?  * Short Sellers Fleeing Netflix, Alphabet And Other Tech Stocks Heading Into 2021(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

As of 11:45 a.m. EST Wednesday, shares of Clean Energy Fuels Corp (NASDAQ: CLNE) are up 9.4%, Westport Fuel Systems (NASDAQ: WPRT) is up 10%, and Energy Fuels (NYSEMKT: UUUU) is exploding 13.5% higher.

fe2817fd-9af2-313c-b2ed-d83d8e7dd741;CLNE;Return On Capital Employed Overview: Clean Energy Fuels;Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ: CLNE) reported Q3 sales of $70.89 million. Earnings fell to a loss of $2.79 million, resulting in a 63.44% decrease from last quarter. Clean Energy Fuels collected $59.87 million in revenue during Q2, but reported earnings showed a $7.62 million loss.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Clean Energy Fuels posted an ROCE of -0.01%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on CLNEReturn on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders.For Clean Energy Fuels, the return on capital employed ratio shows the current amount of assets may not actually be helping the company achieve higher returns, a note many investors will take into account when making long-term financial decisions.Q3 Earnings Recap Clean Energy Fuels reported Q3 earnings per share at $-0.01/share, which beat analyst predictions of $-0.02/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Tuesday  * Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On Monday(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

The company could also benefit from a Biden administration that's putting a huge emphasis on clean energy.What Happened: On Monday, Clean Energy Fuels expanded a partnership with Total SE (NYSE: TOT). A 50/50 joint venture will be created to develop carbon-negative renewable natural gas production facilities.The deal with Total, who is the company's largest shareholder, also includes funding for building additional downstream RNG fueling infrastructure.Total will provide $50 million to the joint venture and Clean Energy Fuels will provide $30 million. Total will provide Clean Energy Fuels with an additional $65 million in credit support, which includes contracted RNG fueling infrastructure.Clean Energy Fuels also signed a deal with BP (NYSE: BP) to make more carbon-negative fuel available for transportation. The deal calls for Clean Energy Fuels to develop, own and operate new RNG facilities at dairies and other agriculture facilities. BP will provide $50 million to the company for its efforts.Related Link: Stocks That Hit 52-Week Highs On TuesdayWhy It's Important: Clean Energy Fuels is the largest provider of RNG in the United States and Canada.

Redeem was the first commercially available RNG vehicle fuel. Redeem reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 70% and up to 300% making it a negative carbon fuel.The company also applauded the passage of the Alternative Fuel Tax Credit by Congress. This extends a credit of $0.50 per gallon of fuel using RNG through 2021, which could help Clean Energy Fuels extend or land new deals.CLNE Price Action: Shares of Clean Energy Fuels closed up 38% to $8.20 on Tuesday.

3f703148-b393-38a4-807f-4bd2a4ee7dfe;RIOT;Will Marathon Patent Group Or Riot Blockchain Stock Grow More By 2022? (Update);Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios.We surveyed a group of over 500 Benzinga investors on whether shares of Marathon Patent Group Inc (NASDAQ: MARA) or Riot Blockchain Inc (NASDAQ: RIOT) stock would grow the most by 2022.Marathon Patent Vs. Riot Blockchain Marathon is a digital asset technology company that mines cryptocurrencies, with a focus on the blockchain ecosystem. The company operates a proprietary data center in Hardin, Montana, with a maximum power capacity of 105 megawatts. Once fully deployed, Marathon will have 103,000 Bitmain S19 Pro Antminers in operation at this facility. The company also owns 2,060 advanced ASIC Bitcoin miners at a co-hosted facility in North Dakota.  Our team reported the road to zero for the company was halted in March at $0.35 and had rallied to as high $5.25 in August, but fell back to end October at $2.16. While Bitcoin broke over $10,000 in August and kept going, buyers were cautious of Marathon.But when the Bitcoin rally began to really accelerate in mid-November and December, so did Marathon. The stock nearly tripled in November, from $2.16 to $6.28, and doubled from there in December, when it peaked at $14.86 and retreated to end the year at $10.44.Riot Blockchain builds, supports and operates a blockchain technologies ecosystem. The company is involved in digital currency mining operation, which uses specialized computers that generate digital currency, primarily Bitcoin. Riot also purchases and sells digital currencies, and provides accounting, audit and verification services for blockchain-based assets. The company developed TessPay, a payments ecosystem for component and sub-component supply chain settlements.This week's report saw 57% of respondents telling us they believe shares of Riot will grow more than Marathon by 2022.Respondents noted there is a sufficient lack of publicly traded mining equities based in the United States. Given their popularity, it can be said Riot and Marathon are the two bitcoin mining equities most likely to reach midcap status this year. Many respondents said both firms will continue to capture retail and institutional attention in sympathy with Bitcoin's current bull run. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in January 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older.Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults.Photo courtesy of Riot Blockchain.

a8e8e138-1e20-3077-b65c-f7edb19654f3;RIOT;4 Crypto Mining Stocks Worth Investing In;"Bitcoin (CCC:BTC) rallied in 2020 as it nearly quadrupled in price from $8,000 in January 2020 to above $31,000 in late December. It reached a new all-time high above $34,000 in 2021. An indirect way to gain from this price appreciation is to consider crypto mining stocks to buy.
Here is simple explanation of the mining process from Sectigostore.com:
“The term crypto mining means gaining cryptocurrencies by solving cryptographic equations through the use of computers. This process involves validating data blocks and adding transaction records to a public record (ledger) known as a blockchain.”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
Crypto mining is a complicated process. It requires a lot of capital expenditures in technology equipment. And, it has significant expenses in terms of electricity and even cooling equipment for a large number of computers used.
The crypto mining business is risky but can be promising and profitable if bitcoin appreciates in the future. Research on global cryptocurrency mining market by Industry Research is optimistic about the growth of this market in the next five to six years.
“The global Cryptocurrency Mining market size is projected to reach US$ 2584.6 million by 2026, from US$ 1015.9 million in 2020, at a CAGR of 16.8% during 2021-2026.”
Meanwhile, a report by Technavio projects growth of $2.8 billion in the mining hardware market from 2020 through 2024.
10 of 2020’s Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks
With growth expected both for the cryptocurrency mining and its hardware, cryptocurrency mining stocks are worth considering. For investors interested in positions related to bitcoin, here are four crypto mining stocks to buy:
Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT)
Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ:MARA)
Canaan (NASDAQ:CAN)
HIVE Blockchain Technologies (OTC:HVBTF)

Crypto Mining Stocks to Buy: RIOT
Source: Shutterstock
	
Leading the way of the crypto mining stocks to buy is Riot Blockchain, which is based in Castle Rock, Colorado, and was founded in 2000. Its stock has a market capitalization of more than $1 billion. Its stock price surged from $1.49 in January 2020 to top $16 per share in late December 2020.
The company is investing in its bitcoin mining business expansion heavily as it announced “an expected 65% increase in bitcoin mining hash rate capacity resulting from the purchase and future deployment of 15,000 S19 Pro and S19j Pro Antminers from Bitmain Technologies Limited.”
Riot Blockchain and its stock could benefit from future expansion and upgrading mining operations. The company is unprofitable for the past three years and an increase in bitcoin price could be a key catalyst for profitability.

Marathon Patent Group (MARA)

Small-cap stocks such as MARA in general are higher risk compared to large-caps. With a market capitalization of less than $600 million, this stock has great risk, but also the potential for high returns. And in 2020 this crypto mining stock delivered an exceptional return soaring from just over $1 per share to about $14 per share in December 2020.
It is based in Las Vegas and its fundamentals are not inspiring. What is worth mentioning is a recent by the company that, “According to publicly available Bitcoin profit calculators, if all the miners we have purchased were deployed today, and Bitcoin’s price was $28,000/BTC, we would produce approximately $618 million in revenue annually and approximately $523 million in gross profit annually.”
10 of 2020’s Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks
Marathon patent group also is investing heavily in expanding its crypto mining business. If the above statement is true, then the price-sales ratio of the stock would be now below 1. The good news is that bitcoin surpassed $28,000. The further price increase could also boost the profitability of the company and support a higher stock price.

Canaan (CAN)

Canaan is based in China and manufactures hardware that can be used for bitcoin mining. It will benefit if companies invest more in equipment for an efficient and cost-effective crypto mining business. Expectations of selling more hardware are realistic and that’s why it is on this list of crypto mining stocks to buy.
Also in this case, the story about the fundamentals is true. The company is not yet profitable and third-quarter 2020 results were not good for revenue. Still, there is some good news. The company announced in September 2020 a $10 million share repurchase program over the next 12 months. However, that anmount may seem trivial for a company with a market capitalization of more than $1 billion.
The repurchase reflects the optimism of the company’s management for future business conditions.

Hive Blockchain Technologies (HVBTF)

The last entry on the list of crypto mining stocks to buy is Hive Blockchain Technologies, which has a price-earnings ratio of 43.33. Not something to call it a bargain stock, but still it is profitable. The company is based in Canada with operations in Canada, Sweden and Iceland.
The key to success for this small-cap stock is to increase revenues and control costs. For the revenue part, it has already shown a successful positive trend increase for the past three consecutive years. And its operating income for the 12 trailing months is positive.
A recent acquisition allows the company to doubles its bitcoin production capacity, as reported by AccessWire, is positive.
10 of 2020’s Most Fascinating SPAC Stocks
The novel coronavirus pandemic posed severe problems for crypto mining companies in logistics and the supply of miners. A return to normal business conditions will be a positive factor for these crypto mining stocks.

1c3ff936-c530-3d07-96dc-4cc84e57808a;RIOT;Unusual Options Activity Insight: Riot Blockchain;"Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) shares experienced unusual options activity on Friday. The stock price moved up to $26.79 following the option alert.  * Sentiment: BEARISH  * Option Type: TRADE  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2021-06-18  * Strike Price: $35.00  * Volume: 886  * Open Interest: 1576Three Ways Options Activity Is 'Unusual'Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.""Out of the money"" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. ""Out of the money"" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.Understanding Sentiment Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 12 Information Technology Stocks Moving In Thursday's After-Market Session  * 10 Information Technology Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

d8691910-ff65-3392-96bf-7336e1426a23;RIOT;Analyzing Riot Blockchain's Unusual Options Activity;"On Wednesday, shares of Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $13.94.  * Sentiment: BULLISH  * Option Type: SWEEP  * Trade Type: CALL  * Expiration Date: 2020-12-24  * Strike Price: $15.00  * Volume: 10635  * Open Interest: 11524Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.Contracts that are ""out of the money"" are also indicative of unusual options activity. ""Out of the money"" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are ""bullish"" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are ""bearish"" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.For more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alertsSee more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 12 Information Technology Stocks Moving In Tuesday's Intraday Session  * 10 Information Technology Stocks With Unusual Options Alerts In Today's Session(C) 2020 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ: RIOT) (""Riot”, “Riot Blockchain” or the “Company""), announces an expected 65% increase in bitcoin mining hash rate capacity resulting from the purchase and future deployment of 15,000 S19 Pro and S19j Pro Antminers from Bitmain Technologies Limited (“Bitmain”). The approximate $35 million purchase is comprised of 3,000 S19 Pro Antminers (110 TH) and 12,000 S19j Pro Antminers (100 TH). These additional miners are scheduled for receipt and deployment starting in May 2021 and continuing through October 2021.This new order of miners, combined with the Company’s prior miner purchases, is expected to significantly increase Riot’s estimated bitcoin mining hash rate from the previously announced 2.3 EH/s to 3.8 EH/s.   The Company has been receiving and deploying new miners consistently through 2020, including this new purchase; the delivery schedule continues into the fourth quarter of 2021.At full deployment of Riot’s 37,640 next-generation fleet of miners, Riot estimates its total operational hash rate capacity will be 3.8 EH/s and consume approximately 120 MW of energy. As a result, the Company expects to have an aggregate mining efficiency of 31.79±% 5 joules per terahash (J/TH).  “Continued growth in deployed miners is paramount to a miner’s success,” said Jeff McGonegal, CEO of Riot. “Expanding the Company’s bitcoin mining hash rate and operating on a cost-effective basis is very important, particularly during periods when the bitcoin spot price has appreciably increased. We are pleased to have secured this latest purchase, especially given that the available supply of mining hardware continues to become increasingly scarce.”""We are extremely excited to expand and deepen our partnership with Riot Blockchain again this year.  In total, Riot additionally purchased 15,000 Antminer 19 series. The 19 series enjoy a wide popularity in the global markets with outstanding hash rates and power efficiency, which continuously bring tremendous values to our customers around the world. I am confident that with the new purchase, Riot can continue to grow their mining operation and play an increasingly vital role in bitcoin mining across North America.” said Irene Gao, Antminer Sales Director of NCSA Region, Bitmain.All miner purchases continue to be funded using available working capital. Riot has no long-term debt. The Company is continuing to assess the bitcoin landscape with the assistance of XMS Capital in evaluating opportunities and transactions to further increase shareholder value.About BitmainFounded in 2013, Bitmain transforms computing by building industry-defining technology in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI).

899e7896-5508-3dbc-bb9a-3c3b683b712d;RIOT;Riot Blockchain Announces 8 MW Pilot Project to Evaluate Latest Generation Immersion Module Technology and Innovative Energy Strategies in Texas;"Enigma’s 3MW BTC Mining ContainerCastle Rock, Colorado, Dec. 14, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CASTLE ROCK, Colo., December 14, 2020 –  Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) (""Riot"" or the ""Company""), one of the few Nasdaq-listed bitcoin mining companies in the United States, announces an 8 megawatt (MW) pilot project to assess the potential for higher productivity and lower cost mining opportunities in Texas.  Riot has teamed up with two leading-edge technology companies, Enigma Digital Assets AG (“Enigma”) and Lancium, LLC (“Lancium”) to launch the pilot project.  The pilot project has the unique dual focus of evaluating Enigma’s next-generation immersion technology to increase mining productivity, in addition to evaluating Lancium’s Smart Response™ software to reduce energy costs.“Bitcoin mining is about scale, low-cost infrastructure and ultra low-cost electricity,” stated Michael McNamara, CEO of Lancium.  “Enigma’s innovative solutions appear to offer a very meaningful improvement on installed cost and productivity.  Lancium’s power-ramping and trading expertise perfectly complements this by delivering an innovative solution to provide the pilot project with low-cost, optimized electricity.”“Our new mining modules are amoung the world’s most powerful, efficient and heat-resilient solutions for mining Bitcoin,” said Jakov Dolic, Co-Founder of Enigma.  “Large economies of scale allows rapid ROI, and resilience to heat enhances operating performace in hotter climates, especially where powered with low-cost electricity.  We are extremely excited to launch this relationship with Riot and Lancium.”“We are pleased to announce the pilot project and look forward to advancing the Company’s relationships with Lancium and Enigma,” said Jeff McGonegal, CEO of Riot.  “Enigma’s immersion modules provide significant potential benefits and Lancium’s Smart Response™ software helps miners reduce their cost of power by being opportunistic in the local energy market.  When combined, both technologies have the potential to reduce Riot’s bitcoin production costs, increase hashrates and significantly extend the life of the Company’s bitcoin mining ASICs.”During the pilot project, Lancium will provide 8 MW of power for the pilot project.  The initial 3 MW will be dedicated to a current-generation Enigma immersion module, for use with S19-Pro ASIC miners.  A further 5 MW will be made available for Enigma’s next-generation immersion module solution, which is currently in final development and expected to be available in early 2021 for the pilot project.  This next-generation immersion module solution involves proprietary ASIC chips and an entirely new cooling solution.  Both modules are the first of their kind from Enigma.  Riot will control the pilot project with Enigma providing the immersion containers and Lancium licensing its Smart Response™ software.The pilot project represents the first Controllable Load Resource in the Houston Load zone, with the  energization of the facility planned for Q1 2021.  If successful, Riot may seek to expand upon the pilot project at larger-scale sites.XMS Capital Partners, LLC acted as a financial advisor to Riot Blockchain in connection with the transaction.About Riot BlockchainRiot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) specializes in cryptocurrency mining with a focus on bitcoin.  Riot also holds non-controlling investments in blockchain technology companies.  Riot is headquartered in Castle Rock, Colorado, and the Company's primary mining facility is located in Massena, New York under a colocation agreement with Coinmint.  For more information, visit www.RiotBlockchain.com.About EnigmaEnigma is a technology company creating unique hardware and software solutions for large scale, industrial Bitcoin mining.  At 3MW per 40 feet container, Enigma’s mining modules have amoung the world's highest power and hashrate density.  Next generation Enigma modules are designed to potentially set new performance records in early 2021 with a power density of 6MW per 40 feet container.  Enigma is based in Switzerland and produces hardware at its factory in Nuremberg, Germany, under multiple patents pending and in process. About LanciumLancium is a technology company creating software and intellectual property solutions that enable more renewable energy on the nation’s power grid.  Lancium’s products include Lancium Smart Response™ for rapid server power management, and Lancium Compute™, a platform for high throughput computing applications.  Lancium’s solutions help ensure that renewable energy can power our future.

6f9ca6a6-6b9c-3cc1-8aa9-bec693448c04;FEYE;Suspected Russian Hackers Targeted Cyber Firm Malwarebytes;(Bloomberg) -- Suspected Russian hackers targeted the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes Inc. in the course of a sprawling cyber-attack that breached U.S. government agencies and companies.The attacker abused “applications with privileged access to Microsoft Office 365 and Azure environments,” according to a Tuesday blog post by Chief Executive Officer Marcin Kleczynski. He said the attack was part of the same hacking campaign that has utilized infected software from SolarWinds Corp. to target other organizations.“After an extensive investigation, we determined the attacker only gained access to a limited subset of internal company emails. We found no evidence of unauthorized access or compromise in any of our internal on-premises and production environments,” Kleczynski wrote.U.S. intelligence agencies and the FBI have said the recent hacking campaign -- which was found and disclosed by the cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. in December -- was likely undertaken by Russia. In many instances, attackers broke into systems through a compromised version of widely used software from Texas-based SolarWinds Corp.However, analysts have said that SolarWinds’s software wasn’t the only method the suspected Russian hackers used to breach networks. On Tuesday, the firm Symantec discovered a new form of malware used in the attack that wasn’t delivered through SolarWinds, suggesting the hack could be broader than previously understood. The firm CrowdStrike Inc. said the hackers had attempted to break into their networks by compromising a third-party vendor that resells Microsoft services. If a reseller is breached and has access to a client’s credentials, the attacker could then hack into the client’s networks.On Dec. 15, Microsoft alerted Malwarebytes about “suspicious activity from a third-party application” that was consistent with the behaviors of the hackers that had exploited SolarWinds. Upon investigation, Malwarebytes found “no evidence of unauthorized access or compromise in any of our internal on-premises and production environments,” he wrote.Jeff Jones, a Microsoft representative, said in a statement, “Our ongoing investigation of recent attacks has found this advanced and sophisticated threat actor had several techniques in their toolkit. We have not identified any vulnerabilities in our products or cloud services.”Malwarebytes’s disclosure is the latest example of the attackers targeting security companies in the course of the hacking campaign. They stole tools from FireEye and attempted to breach CrowdStrike, the companies said last month.“These attackers were clearly sophisticated and primarily targeted federal agencies and security companies, as far as I’m aware,” Kleczynski said in an email to Bloomberg News.FireEye’s investigation into its own breach last month revealed that the hackers had installed malicious code into SolarWinds’s Orion software, which is used by government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. The malicious code, which customers received by updating the software, provided a launching pad of sorts for further attacks by the hackers into computer networks.According to SolarWinds, as many as 18,000 of its customers may have received infected updates, though the hackers are believed to have conducted further intrusions in far fewer of them. Malwarebytes isn’t a SolarWinds customer.(Updates with Microsoft statement in seventh paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Wed, 20 Jan 2021 01:10:59 +0000;FEYE_2021-01-20;-0.9745;-0.2263

c6daafc7-2ec0-318e-ae16-63cf2805d513;WISH;ContextLogic: WISH Stock Could Deserve A Place on Your Wish List;Founded in 2010, San Francisco-based ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH) is a fast-growing global e-commerce platform focusing on discounted goods. Since going public in mid-December 2020, WISH stock has returned over 10% and is currently hovering at $26. Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com Wish’s platform is based on a personalized and visual browsing experience. One could compare it to how one browses around in a physical store. Therefore, the company has been able to generate significant buzz around its platform and app. The Wish app has become one of the most downloaded global shopping apps in the past several years. Currently, the company has more than 100 million monthly active users as well as over 500,000 merchants around the world.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Today’s article discusses what investors can expect from WISH stock in the early part of the year. If you are not yet a shareholder, you could consider starting a position in WISH shares, especially if declines toward $22.50 or lower. As it is still early days for the group, the road ahead could be choppy. However, I expect the shares to create significant shareholder value in the coming quarters. Recent Earnings Global e-retail sales hit $3.53 trillion in 2019. Then came the exponential growth in 2020. Consumers were already drifting towards online shopping before the coronavirus pandemic became the dominant force in our lives. Last year, the move to e-commerce has gained further momentum, as many retailers have been temporarily closed all over the world. 7 Great Sub-$20 Stocks to Buy After Inauguration Day Meanwhile, investors are looking for the next Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP) to bet their fortunes on. Therefore, a recent IPO like WISH stock gets significant headlines. The company released Q3 earnings in mid-December and painted a mixed financial picture. Revenue was $606 million and increased by 33% YoY. Net loss was $99 million compared to a loss of $134 million a year ago. When looking at the metrics for the first nine months of 2020, analysts were concerned to see a net loss of $176 million. A year ago, it had been a net loss of $5 million in the same period. Put another way, despite the growth, ContextLogic’s profitability metrics are headed in the wrong direction. CEO Peter Szulczewski said, “Based on data, we will both double down and pull back on various initiatives as we continually pursue better performance and results. We have made great progress to date, but we are still in the very early days of our journey and are excited for what lies ahead.” Despite the growth in revenue, the stock is richly valued. It currently has a market capitalization of about $15 billion. Although the company potentially has a lot of room to run, the short-term moves in the share price may not necessarily be smooth sailing. Furthermore, there are question marks around the quality of products sold on the platform. By selling discounted goods, ContextLogic has definitely created a niche for itself. However, the lower-quality has also created customer complaints. The issue of quality may create headwinds for WISH stock. The Bottom Line in WISH Stock The Street’s interest in e-commerce stocks is likely to continue in the new year. The “stay-at-home, work-from-home” trend of last year has contributed to the growth of online shopping worldwide. As a result, e-commerce apps have become among the most popular apps downloaded on smartphones. The Street also has a big appetite for new offerings. However, it is important to remember that WISH stock does not yet have a long trading history. Also, the company is still unprofitable. As I find WISH stock frothy at these levels, I’d wait to invest until the next earnings statement is released. Therefore, if you have a two- to three- year horizon, you could consider investing in the shares if WISH stock declines toward $22.50 or even lower. Meanwhile, in the long-run, the company could also find itself a takeover candidate. Investors who are not yet ready to commit capital into WISH stock could also consider investing in an exchange traded fund (ETF) focusing on e-commerce. Examples include the Amplify Online Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:IBUY), the Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce ETF (NYSEARCA:EMQQ), the Global X E-Commerce ETF (NASDAQ:EBIZ), the ProShares Online Retail ETF (NYSEARCA:ONLN). Similarly, those market participants who are interested in participating in the growth of newly listed companies may consider the First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF (NYSEARCA:FPX), the Renaissance IPO ETF (NYSEARCA:IPO), or the First Trust IPOX Europe Equity Opportunities ETF (NASDAQ:FPXE).

1609605a-cbed-30a6-8cef-22fe99325d4d;BE;3 Megatrends (and 9 Stocks) to Buy for the ‘Blue Wave’;"What a wild week…
The most attention-grabbing thing that happened? The storming of the U.S. Capitol when Congress was in session and in the process of confirming Joe Biden as the next President of the United States.
Talk about wild!InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips
But – while that event may have dominated the news headlines, and rightly so – it was mostly a non-event for markets. They didn’t care.
Why?
Because something far, far more important happened this week. Something that will have lasting and significant impact on the economy and on markets.
That thing, of course, is Democrats flipping control of the Senate.
Democrats needed to win both Georgia Senate runoff elections to tie Republicans in terms of number of Senate seats, with the tie-breaker going to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris (who is, of course, a staunch Democrat).
They did just that. Both Democratic candidates won their runoffs in Georgia. Now, Democrats are in control of the Senate for the next two years.

They will also control the White House and the House of Representatives. Which means President-elect Joe Biden is now in a position of strength when it comes to enacting sweeping legislation that will meaningfully impact the U.S. economy.
Ostensibly, that may seem like a bad thing for markets, because Democrats want higher taxes and tighter regulation. But the stock market actually rallied big on the news.
Why?
The general thinking is that what Democrats want to do first (provide stimulus to combat Covid-19 economic impacts and combat climate change) is a net positive for the economy and financial markets. The higher taxes and tighter regulation part will come later. Maybe not even before the 2022 midterms, and even if it does, the split of power in Congress is so equal that any successful legislation on those fronts will very likely have to be moderate in nature.
Thus, Wall Street sees a “Blue Wave” as a win for the economy. You get guaranteed big stimulus now, and maybe moderately higher taxes and somewhat tighter regulation a few years from now.
Don’t be afraid of the Blue Wave … embrace it. The fundamentals underlying the U.S. economy and the stock market remain healthy and vigorous. The outlook for stocks to push higher both in 2021 and throughout the next several years remains robust.
With all that said, the Blue Wave is a particularly bullish development for three industries. Democrats flipping the Senate essentially propelled these three megatrends into hypergrowth mode – and now all three trends are positioned for several years of huge gains ahead.
Which industries am I talking about?
Solar, hydrogen and cannabis.
Solar energy adoption was already on a huge upswing before the 2020 Election. Falling costs, improving technology and shifting consumer demand all compelled homeowners and businesses alike to more seriously consider installing solar panels. Now, significant political catalysts are in the pipeline, too, as a Democratic-controlled government will almost certainly make it a priority to pass major clean energy bill in 2021. Meaningfully upping and extending solar subsidies will likely be the focal point of that bill.
In other words, the solar market is primed for several years of hypergrowth ahead.


The story on the hydrogen front is very similar. Hydrogen subsidies will likely also be significantly increased and extended in 2021-22. This major political tailwind will couple with economic tailwinds (hydrogen costs are steadily falling) and technology tailwinds (the emergence of “green hydrogen” has enabled a new era of zero-emission hydrogen production) to spark a boom in the Hydrogen Economy in the 2020s.
Pivoting to cannabis, this megatrend is all about legal developments. The demand is there. We know that. Just look at the black market for cannabis. That’s a $70 billion industry in the U.S. alone – and a multi-hundred-billion-dollar industry globally.
Thus, the cannabis megatrend isn’t about generating new demand for weed. It’s about transferring the already enormous demand for weed from the black market to the legal market. A Blue Wave, which paves a clear path toward federal cannabis legalization, is a huge step in this transfer of demand. It also comes on the heels of Canada federally legalizing cannabis, and Mexico doing so soon.
All in all, the geopolitical stage is set for enormous global cannabis demand to shift into the legal channel over the next decade. This seismic shift will power big gains in marijuana stocks.
Big picture: It’s time to get extra bullish on hypergrowth solar, hydrogen and cannabis stocks.
My top picks?
I like three stocks in each industry:
9 Hot Stocks to Buy Across 3 Scorching Megatrends
In solar, I like SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) for its unmatched leadership in the premium solar installation category, Maxeon Solar (NASDAQ:MAXN) for its strong technical expertise in manufacturing the world’s best solar panels and SolarEdge (NASDAQ:SEDG) for its dominance in the increasingly important solar optimizers and inverters market.
For hydrogen, I like Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) as the Hydrogen Economy leader building on its early dominance in supplying hydrogen fuel cells to the materials handling market, Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) for its ability to leverage fuel cells to help businesses generate sustainable and cost-effective off-grid power, and Ballard Power (NASDAQ:BLDP) because the company is emerging as a mini-Plug Power of sorts in the transportation market (providing fuel cells into transit end-markets).
Finally, in cannabis, I’m most bullish on Canopy Growth (NASDAQ:CGC) because of its multi-billion-dollar cash balance that gives it unmatched firepower to invest in the emerging marijuana industry, GrowGeneration (NASDAQ:GRWG) because this small retailer is rapidly turning into the “Home Depot of Cannabis” and WM Holdings (NASDAQ:SSPK) for its Weedmaps platform that is already established as the “Google of Marijuana.”
These nine stocks represent the highest-quality, biggest-upside plays on the solar, hydrogen and cannabis megatrends.
And each of those megatrends is ready to sprint into hypergrowth mode.
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to connect those dots.

778e57e8-c385-32bc-8d21-11f9855d19b8;BE;Looking Into Bloom Energy's Return On Capital Employed;Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) reported Q3 sales of $200.31 million. Earnings fell to a loss of $372.00 thousand, resulting in a 98.74% decrease from last quarter. In Q2, Bloom Energy brought in $187.86 million in sales but lost $29.50 million in earnings.Why ROCE Is Significant Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q3, Bloom Energy posted an ROCE of -0.01%.Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future.View more earnings on BEROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Bloom Energy is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth.For Bloom Energy, the return on capital employed ratio shows the current amount of assets may not actually be helping the company achieve higher returns, a note many investors will take into account when making long-term financial decisions.Q3 Earnings Insight Bloom Energy reported Q3 earnings per share at $-0.04/share, which beat analyst predictions of $-0.12/share.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * 10 Industrials Stocks Showing Unusual Options Activity In Today's Session  * Why Bloom Energy's Stock is Up During Today's Session(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

d0f3ec30-72a2-32fa-823f-7c709e0d6d6e;TSLA;Tencent’s $232 Billion Rally Triggers Frenzy in Shares, Options;(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s equity traders can’t get enough of Tencent Holdings Ltd., the $930 billion giant that’s on pace for its biggest ever monthly gain.They’re paying up for bullish derivatives tracking the Chinese internet firm, buying thousands of January call options that expire Thursday. The price of one Tencent contract -- which bets the stock will rise past HK$800 by expiry -- surged as much as 90,300% on Monday. Traders also rushed to offload their bearish puts, with one of the most-traded contracts losing some 84% in value.The stock rallied as much as 10% on Monday to HK$760, accounting for about two-fifths of the gains on the Hang Seng Index. The Hong Kong benchmark rose 2.1% and is set to close above the key 30,000 point-level for the first time since May 2019.Tencent has become a prime target for mainland traders flooding record amounts of cash into Hong Kong-listed shares this year, with net purchase of the stock accounting for roughly a quarter of total money coming in, according to exchange data. The buying frenzy has also boosted Tencent’s market value by about $232 billion this year, the most worldwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla Inc. is the second-largest gainer, up $134 billion.Tencent shares now trade at almost 39 times analysts’ estimated earnings for the next 12 months. While that’s well above the average of 30 since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 2005, it’s still below the recent peak multiple of 42 reached in 2014 and 2018. It reached 65 at the height of China’s equity bubble in 2007.On Monday, analysts at Citigroup Inc. lifted their target price on the firm by 19% to HK$876, the highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg, citing the company’s market-share expansion and growth in the gaming sector and other digital businesses.Tencent is also getting an additional boost from taking part in the city’s fast-growing initial public offering market. Kuaishou Technology, backed by Tencent, is seeking to raise as much as $5.4 billion in Hong Kong in what would be the biggest internet IPO since Uber Technologies Inc.With the recent run-up, Tencent is trading at its highest price on record. It’s largely avoided the tightening regulatory oversight that sparked a selloff in rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and forced its part-owned Ant Group Co. to jettison a record IPO.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.;Mon, 25 Jan 2021 05:38:27 +0000;TSLA_2021-01-25;0.9477;-0.0258

The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration previously asked Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) to recall 158,716 Model S and Model X vehicles over safety concerns related to touchscreen displays not working.According to the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, the German authorities have been in contact with NHTSA and the KBA has launched its own investigation. Why It Matters: The U.S. auto safety agency tentatively concluded the 2012-2018 Model S and 2016-2018 Model X vehicles contain a defect related to motor vehicle safety. The recall of 158,716 vehicles represents around 10% of the company's total vehicles produced through the end of 2020.Photo by David von Diemar on Unsplash.See more from Benzinga  * Click here for options trades from Benzinga  * Wedbush Raises Target As It Predicts Cloud Services Will Lift Microsoft Above Wall Street Estimates  * China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Company Attracts 6 Investors To Raise .4 billion(C) 2021 Benzinga.com.

A potential next ""major milestone"" for Tesla, he said, is the possibility that Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk could group his different busineses, which also include SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company, into one superstructure.

General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) Hummer Electric Vehicle took second place at 41%.Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Ford-backed Rivian came ahead of Tesla at 39%. The Elon Musk-led automaker's Cybertruck came in at the last spot at 19%. In terms of consideration, Ford led the pack at 45%, with three-quarters of respondents likely to consider the vehicle. Tesla came in second at 32%, Hummer at 28%, and Rivian at 25%.""Tesla and Rivian R1T scored well with younger buyers, and Rivian performed well among female buyers as well,"" said Vanessa Ton, senior manager, Cox Automotive.Why It Matters: The non-traditional look of the Tesla Cybertruck didn't impress potential buyers, according to the study.Price, performance, design, and size matter the most to potential EV truck customers, while the brand name and work use were the least important.""Ford leads in every attribute except tech advanced, where Hummer and Rivian are nearly tied for the lead,"" according to Cox Automotive.See Also: Ford's Electric F-150 Coming In 2022, Over-The-Air Updates PlannedTesla was ranked the lowest among important attributes that matter the most to pickup truck shoppers, as per the study.See Also: Jay Leno Takes Elon Musk For A Drive In A Tesla CybertruckPrice Action: Ford shares closed mostly unchanged on Friday at $11.52 and gained 0.43% in the after-hours session.

""We manufacture a completely autonomous driving system. Tesla is an automaker that is developing a really good driver assistance system,"" Business Insider reported, citing the interview.The executive claimed that Waymo's sensor setup is ""orders of magnitude better.""""It is a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system,"" Krafcik said, as per Business Insider.Why It Matters: The auto executive said that the ""costs for the technology are greatly overestimated"" in the case of Waymo, Forbes reported.Krafcik said the costs of owning one of Waymo's vehicles were comparable to a moderately equipped Daimler AG (OTC: DDAIF) made Mercedes S-Class sedan.That vehicle costs nearly $180,000 in the United States, as per Forbes. Waymo utilizes LiDAR technology in its vehicles. Last year, Waymo had said its autonomy strategy was ""orders of magnitude more advanced"" than the competition -- in a jibe apparently aimed at Tesla.This month, Waymo said it would stop referencing the term ""self-driving"" and instead use more ""deliberate language"" in relation to its technology and call it ""fully autonomous driving tech"" to distinguish itself from other companies that use the term.Musk said this month that even if the cost of lidar sensors became zero, Tesla would not utilize them. Price Action: On Friday, Alphabet Class A shares closed 0.45% higher at $1,892.56 and Class C shares closed nearly 0.5% higher at $1,901.05.

58f04fc8-5934-37ca-9f9d-f551eb596440;WISH;"ContextLogic’s 1Q Revenue Outlook Exceeds Expectations After 4Q Beat; Shares Rise";"Shares of ContextLogic were up 4.8% in Tuesday’s pre-market session as the online e-commerce platform provided 1Q revenue guidance that topped the Street’s estimates. Meanwhile, 4Q revenues beat analysts’ expectations. ContextLogic's (WISH) revenues increased 38% year-on-year to $794 million and came in ahead of analysts’ expectations of $736.1 million. Top-line growth was driven by robust demand for its Marketplace and Logistics services. Core marketplace revenue per active buyer in 4Q rose 66% year-over-year and grew 25% from 3Q levels. The company’s CEO, Peter Szulczewski, said, “Our efforts to improve buyer monetization and engage with high lifetime value customers drove strong year over year and sequential growth in Core Marketplace Revenue per Active Buyer.” However, the company reported a loss of $3.04 per share in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $1.20 per share in the year-ago quarter. Analysts were anticipating a loss of $3.03 per share. ContextLogic reported an adjusted EBITDA loss of $118 million, wider than the year-ago loss of $116 million. As for 1Q, ContextLogic forecasts revenues in the range of $735-750 million, much higher than consensus estimates of $668.3 million. (See ContextLogic stock analysis on TipRanks) Following the results, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein lowered the stock’s price target to $25 (56.8% upside potential) from $30, “on broad peer multiple compression, despite a solid inaugural earnings print and outlook, that should quell investor concerns over recent volatility around revenue.” In a note to investors, the analyst said, “We believe WISH will continue to invest heavily in scaling Logistics offering (Logistics-as-a-Service pilot launched in 4Q). While this may yield gross margins structurally lower than today, we believe it offers significantly higher profit potential.” Helfstein maintained a Buy rating on the stock. Overall, consensus among analysts is a Strong Buy based on 9 Buys and 3 Holds. The average analyst price target of $24.90 implies upside potential of over 56% to current levels. Shares have declined 20.5% since the company was listed on the NASDAQ on Dec. 16, 2020. Furthermore, TipRanks data shows that financial blogger opinions are 75% Bullish, compared to a sector average of 69%.

What Happened: The Model Y was the third best-selling electric car in February with 4,630 units sold, as per CPCA data. The Model 3 ranked second in February. The top spot went to the Hong Guang Mini, a vehicle made by a joint venture between General Motors Compay (NYSE: GM) and state-owned SAIC Motor, reported CNBC. Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) reported 2,223 deliveries in February, a 63% decline over January which it attributed to sluggish sales owing to the lunar new year. Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) delivered 707 vehicles in February, which is a 12.8% fall over the preceding month. Why It Matters: Passenger car sales declined 45.5% in February compared with the preceding month, as per CPAC. Tesla began selling the Model Y at the beginning of the year, but the robust demand for the vehicle means that orders are not expected to be filled till the second quarter of 2021.

20d6aade-09cb-324c-b29d-d12b67967533;TSLA;Warren Buffett Becomes Sixth Member Of $100B Wealth Club;"Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) chairman Warren Buffett became the sixth member of the $100 billion club on Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. What Happened: Buffett’s net worth rose to $100.4 billion on Wednesday as the Class A shares of Berkshire hit a record high. It was for the first time ever that the 90-year-old Buffett’s net worth crossed the $100 billion threshold. Buffett now joins five other billionaires in the $100 billion club. They include the world’s richest person Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Known as the “Oracle of Omaha”, Buffett added $1.9 billion to his net worth on Wednesday. Berkshire’s Class A shares have gained 15% year-to-date, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500 Index’s gain of 3.8%. The stock’s gains have been aided by Buffett spending record amounts on buying back the conglomerate’s own stock over the past year. Berkshire spent .7 billion on share buybacks last year. In his annual letter to shareholders in February this year, Buffett hinted that more stock buybacks are to come. See Also: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Cuts Apple Stake And Buys These Drugmaker, Telecom Stocks Instead Why It Matters: Buffett’s entry into the elite $100 billion club comes even as the billionaire is known to be a generous donor.

The company’s Class B shares also closed 1.9% higher at $263.99.

What Happened: The Palo Alto, California-based automaker quietly updated its website with fresh prices for both the Model 3 And Model S EVs Thursday midnight. The updated prices for Model 3 trims are: Model 3 Standard Range Plus is now priced at $37,490 from the earlier $36,990 Model 3 Long Range All-Wheel Drive costs $46,490 and was previously sold for $46,990. Tesla Model 3 Performance price remains unchanged at $55,990 For the Model S vehicles, the new prices are: Model S Long Range All-Wheel Drive price remains unchanged at $79,990 Model S Plaid price remains $119,990 Model S Plaid Plus price shoots up by $10,000 to $149,990 from $139,990 Why It Matters: This is the second price change in Tesla vehicles in recent days. Last month, Tesla had slashed the prices of Model 3 and Model Y vehicle variants. The Model S Plaid Plus will use Tesla’s new 4680 battery cell which allows for faster charging, better power, and performance. See Also: Tesla, LG Chem Negotiate Making 4680 Cells In US And Europe: Report The cells will be packed in the vehicle in a new fashion using the automaker’s structural pack approach.

15d39c5f-4124-32bd-883a-3b7ab35cd261;TSLA;Beyond Tesla And Nio — Companies Exploit China's Mass EV Potential;Segment leaders such as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO), and Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) may have made their mark on the Chinese consumer, but low-priced EVs are enjoying the mass appeal in the East Asian country. Huge Customer Base: EVs, such as a $10,000 crossover vehicle made by Hozon Auto, are attracting customers due to lower maintenance costs and a smaller price tag, reported Bloomberg. “These ultracheap EVs are reaching a new customer in China, as they likely will in other markets as prices come down,” said Siyi Mi, a BloombergNEF analyst. Widening Choice: Availability of a wider range has the Chinese consumer spoilt for choice. There is the Hozon Auto Neta N01. Also available is the e1 minicar from Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett-backed BYD Company Ltd (OTC: BYDDF) priced at $8,950 and the Hong Guang Mini, a two-door vehicle available for just $4,230. The Hong Guang Mini, built by Wuling — a joint venture between General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and the state-owned SAIC Motor — reported sales in excess of those by Tesla’s Model 3 by two-to-one late last month. Need For Low-Cost EVs Felt Elsewhere: Car prices have outrun wage growth in the United States, which means the lowest-earning fifth of the population needs to spend 30% of their income on transportation costs, according to Bloomberg. See also: How to Buy Electric Vehicle (EV) Stocks “Taking into account people’s access to transportation, it’s very important to see a greater diversity of models like EVs being offered on the lower end of the price range,” said Selika Talbott, a professorial lecturer and a founding partner of an automotive consultant company, Bloomberg reported. Priced at just under $30,000, the cheapest EV available in the U.S. after subsidies from a major vehicle maker is General Motors Company’s (NYSE: GM) Mini Cooper SE. Some vehicle manufacturers such as ElectraMeccanica Vehicles Corp (NASDAQ: SOLO) want to change that by introducing single-person vehicles priced under $20,000. The Frontrunner On A Backfoot: In February, Tom Zhu, the president of Tesla China, dismissed news that it is working on a $25,000 mass-market vehicle. Previously some media outlets had reported that such a vehicle would have been sold globally. Xpeng Chairman Brian Gu said last September that the company’s mid-range EVs are already priced around the $25,000 mark.

5bf63df3-0763-3b90-81ae-cbbe4b871335;TSLA;Apple Tilts to iPhone Playbook for Car as Automaker Talks Stall;"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has a tried-and-true approach to launching new products: The company designs in-house, sources its own components, and works with a contract manufacturer to assemble it for sale.As the tech giant plots a foray into the car market, it could adopt a similar strategy -- working with a lesser-known contract manufacturer -- after talks with some brand name automakers stalled.To build a vehicle, Apple has three primary options: Partner with an existing carmaker; build its own manufacturing facilities; or team up with a contract manufacturer such as Foxconn or Magna International Inc.The Cupertino, California-based company has reached out to automakers including Hyundai Motor Co., but the discussions have not gone well. In this scenario, Apple would develop an autonomous system for the vehicle, the interior and external design, and on-board technology, while leaving the final production to the carmaker. Such a deal would essentially ask an existing car company to shed its brand and become a contract assembler for a new rival.A longtime manager at both Apple and Tesla Inc. said this would be like Apple asking bitter smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. to manufacture the iPhone. Apple wants to challenge the assumptions of how a car works -- how the seats are made, how the body looks, the person said. A traditional automaker would be reluctant to help such a potentially disruptive competitor, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private matters.Indeed, discussions between Apple and the car industry seem to have fizzled in recent months. Hyundai and Kia Motors Corp. confirmed talks on the development of an electric car, but backtracked soon after. Apple’s self-driving car team met with representatives from Ferrari NV last year. It’s unclear what was discussed, but the talks didn’t advance, according to a person familiar with the meeting.In February, Nissan Motor Co. said it wasn’t in talks with Apple. Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess said he’s “not scared” of Apple’s entry into the industry. BMW AG’s CFO recently said he sleeps peacefully.For its computers, phones and tablets, Apple relies on contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron, Flex Ltd. and Luxshare. The iPhone maker has avoided building its own factories, an effort that would cost billions of dollars in construction, worker pay and training, along with new liabilities and complex deals with local governments.Factories are generally low-margin businesses. Apple leaves that to partners, while focusing on product design and development. The company’s profit margins dwarf those of suppliers such as Foxconn and Pegatron.Tesla, the most successful electric carmaker to date, has lost billions of dollars running its own factories and only recently began generating regular income. Last year, the company reported a profit of almost $700 million. Apple made more than $60 billion in the same period.Auto industry “profit margins are lower than Apple’s current model,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a recent note to investors. Some luxury brands, such as Ferrari, are more profitable, but those are “edge cases and potentially difficult to replicate at higher volumes,” the analysts added.Apple is more likely to go with a contract manufacturer because that’s the business model they’re used to, said Eric Noble, president of consulting firm the CarLab. He thinks a partnership with an existing carmaker would be a power struggle because both companies are used to tightly controlling their supply chains.This is why Foxconn and Magna are two primary contenders for Apple’s business, according to industry insiders.Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., has an existing relationship with Apple as the main assembler of iPhones. And the Taiwanese company is already branching out into the auto business. In October, it introduced an electric vehicle chassis and a software platform to help carmakers bring models to market faster. Last month, it unveiled a deal to assemble more than 250,000 EVs a year for the startup Fisker Inc.An Apple employee involved in manufacturing said Foxconn is used to having Apple engineers tell it what to do and that the company’s factories are already filled with Apple-designed equipment. The person asked not to be identified discussing sensitive matters.Magna has some history with Apple, too. The two were in talks to build Apple’s car when the iPhone maker first set out on this path about five years ago. Magna is also a lot more experienced at making cars. It assembles luxury models for companies including BMW, Daimler AG and Jaguar Land Rover.The CEO of a well known self-driving car company was surprised to see Apple talking to existing carmakers when an option like Magna exists.Magna is the most logical choice, said Noble, who has worked with the Canadian auto supplier on projects in the past and calls the company “amazingly good” at what they do.For its part, Apple appears to be designing its car with production in mind. The company recently posted a job listing seeking a “senior hands on manufacturing engineer” for its special projects group, the team leading its work on a car. The candidate will be responsible for growing a team of engineers focused on manufacturing strategy and the supply chain. The person is also required to have experience working with aluminum, steel and composites, key materials in cars.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.";Thu, 11 Mar 2021 05:00:00 +0000;TSLA_2021-03-11;0.9835;-0.2023
ea977112-68fd-3d4a-ae5c-ef76264e2ad2;TSLA;Tesla Has Significant Lead Over Rivals In EV Battery Costs: Report;Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) pays significantly less than its rivals for lithium battery cells and has the lowest cost EV battery packs, according to Cairn Energy Research Advisors, CNBC reported Wednesday. What Happened: The Elon Musk-led company spends 10% less on battery packs than its nearest rival General Motors Company (NYSE: GM). Compared with the industry average, Tesla pays 24% less — thanks to an aggressive push to drive costs downwards, according to Sam Jaffe, managing director of Cairn ERA. The lead over rivals is reportedly likely to stay in place through the end of this decade, with GM expected to narrow the gulf. “Everything is focused on cost. The lower the cost, the more affordable the cars become,” said Jaffe. Tesla pays on average $142 per kilowatt-hour for battery cells that it buys from suppliers Panasonic Corporation (OTC: PCRFY), LG Chem, and CATL. Meanwhile, GM pays $169 per kWh and the industry average stands at $186 per kWh, as per Cairn ERA, reported CNBC. In terms of battery packs, Tesla shells out $187 per KWh on average, while GM pays $207 per kWh. The industry average is $246 per kWh. Why It Matters: Jaffe expects GM to get close to achieving price parity with Tesla on battery cells and packs by the end of the decade, CNBC reported. “GM is fully committed and is taking this complete integrative approach which is going to allow it to be very close to Tesla, although the scale still isn’t in the same ballpark as what Tesla is planning,” said Jaffe. Other automakers that are making investments to bridge the gap with Tesla include Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY), as per the Cairn ERA executive. See Also: US Needs To Make Batteries On A Large-Scale To Avoid Chip-Like Shortage, Says Ford CEO In November, GM CEO Mary Barra said that forty percent of the company’s U.S. entries would be battery electric vehicles by 2025. GM also announced a financial commitment to EVs and AVs to the tune of $27 billion through the same period. The automaker is partnering with LG Chem in setting up a second battery manufacturing unit in the United States, according to the Wall Street Journal. On Tuesday, it was reported that the Korean battery supplier is also in talks with Tesla in a bid to make the latter’s latest battery cells in U.S. and Europe. Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 0.8% lower at $668.06 on Wednesday and fell 0.52% in the after-hours session. On the same day, GM shares closed 3.99% higher at $56.83 and fell 0.19% in the after-hours trading. Click here to check out Benzinga’s EV Hub for the latest electric vehicles news.

527ba7e8-a48c-3885-a4ec-d485e0ccb5c3;TSLA;Verkada Workers Had Extensive Access to Private Customer Cameras;"(Bloomberg) -- More than 100 employees at security camera startup Verkada Inc. could peer through the cameras of its thousands of customers, including global corporations, schools and police departments, according to three former employees aware of the company’s security protocols.Verkada was breached on Monday, when hackers gained access to what’s known as a “Super Admin” account that allowed them to see all of the live feeds and archived videos of Verkada’s customers, Bloomberg reported. With access to 150,000 cameras, the hackers were able to see inside Tesla Inc., as well as watch police interviews and witness hospital employees tackling a patient.The use of Super Admin accounts within Verkada was so widespread that it extended even to sales staff and interns, two of the employees said. “We literally had 20-year-old interns that had access to over 100,000 cameras and could view all of their feeds globally,” said one former senior-level employee, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.The San Mateo, California-based company said the access was limited to those employees who needed to address specific engineering or customer issues and that it had strict policies in place to protect its customers’ privacy.“Verkada previously limited access to internal administrator accounts to engineers and support staff so they could address customers’ questions and technical issues,” a company spokesman said in a statement responding to questions from Bloomberg News. “Verkada’s training program and policies for employees are both clear that support staff members were and are required to secure a customer’s explicit permission before accessing that customer’s video feed.”This week’s breach of the company was carried out by an international hacker collective based in Europe. Tillie Kottmann, one of the hackers who claimed credit for the incident, said they wanted to show the pervasiveness of video surveillance and the ease with which those systems could expose users’ confidential spaces.Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, echoed that point in reaction to the incident Wednesday. “Every hack like this one exposes the threat that government and private surveillance will be turned against law-abiding Americans by criminals, predators and spies,” Wyden said in an emailed statement.It is unclear whether most Verkada customers knew its employees could peer through the cameras they purchased from the company. One former employee said it was implied that employees wouldn’t have access, but said engineers were routinely looking at people’s cameras every day.At Verkada, like other companies, Super Admin accounts have legitimate purposes. They are used by engineers to debug products and support staff to assist clients with ongoing issues. But the ease with which the hacktivists gained access to so many live camera feeds suggested that there were limited technical measures in place at Verkada that would prevent its own employees from doing the same thing.And weak security protocols left customers’ confidential spaces open to intruders, according to the former employees. Although using a Super Admin account normally required multi-factor authentication, any user could simply switch it off, one of the former employees said.Some aspects of the use of Super Admin accounts with Verkada were previously reported by IPVM, a publication that covers the surveillance camera industry.One employee said this week’s security breach might have been prevented, since the Super Admin issue had been raised repeatedly by some employees.When an employee accessed a customer’s camera, the Verkada system required them to submit a reason for doing so. Those employee submissions were logged, but that documentation was rarely checked, a former employee said.“Nobody cared about checking the logs,” the person said. “You could put whatever you wanted in that note; you could even just enter a single space.”Verkada also offers a “privacy mode” to customers, allowing cameras to be hidden from Verkada employees, according to a former employee. But Super Admin accounts would allow employees to turn off that feature, allowing them to see the camera footage, the former employee said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.";Thu, 11 Mar 2021 00:31:54 +0000;TSLA_2021-03-11;0.997;0.0
